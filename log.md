# 100 Days Of Code - Log
Day 1: January 2, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Watched introduction videos again. Watched videos for first chapter, on datetimes. Wrote detailed notes and example code in a Jupyter notebook.

**Thoughts:** It seems like there isn't a very distinct day 2, so I will start writing the coding challenge tomorrow and finish it on the third day.

Day 2: January 3, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Completed Python practice challenge, calculating datetimes within a server log on Python Bytes site. Fiddled with datetimes, os, and logging libraries in the notebook.

**Thoughts:** It turns out there is a very distinct day 2. Today's TPTM plan involved completing a coding practice challenge on Python Bytes website. After first use, I am already not a fan of the Python Bytes experience. If it continues to be terrible to work with I can search exercism, codewars, or other alternative for relevant exercises.

Day 3: January 4, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Made small logging script using datetimes, logging, and os.

**Thoughts:** Found Corey Schafer YouTube video to help understand basics of logging and os modules. Used datetimes to add readable datetime log entries instead of unreadable timestamp.

Day 4: January 7, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Started investigating beginning steps and potential project paths for working with Python in Blender. Learned about collections module.

**Thoughts:** I am happy to be getting started with the scripting process in Blender. I have 3d data in the Gradient Descent notebook I am working on, it might be fun to use Python to try and map objects to that data in Blender. As for the collections module, I will certainly start using the namedtuple where it makes sense in my code.

Day 5: January 8, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Reviewed file operations. Day two of learning about collections module.

**Thoughts:** The code challenge for this module is more involved. Because of frustration last time I am working from a notebook rather than the PyBites environment. I couldn't remember the best way to open files but reviewed with a Corey Schafer video. It is important to know how to open most files using a context manager but since this challenge is working with CSV data I think it is best for me to use the familiar Pandas functionality.

Day 6: January 9, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Started an app to render a small picture in Blender.

**Thoughts:** I'm using namedtuple to store pixel color data in app that takes small jpg and writes blender script that will be able to translate pixel data from the picture into a 3d plane of appropriately colored solid cubes.

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
