# 100 Days Of Code - Log
Day 1: January 2, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Watched introduction videos again. Watched videos for first chapter, on datetimes. Wrote detailed notes and example code in a Jupyter notebook.

**Thoughts:** It seems like there isn't a very distinct day 2, so I will start writing the coding challenge tomorrow and finish it on the third day.

Day 2: January 3, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Completed Python practice challenge, calculating datetimes within a server log on Python Bytes site. Fiddled with datetimes, os, and logging libraries in the notebook.

**Thoughts:** It turns out there is a very distinct day 2. Today's TPTM plan involved completing a coding practice challenge on Python Bytes website. After first use, I am already not a fan of the Python Bytes experience. If it continues to be terrible to work with I can search exercism, codewars, or other alternative for relevant exercises.

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
