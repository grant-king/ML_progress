# 100 Days Of Code - Log
Day 0: July 1, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Practiced on CodeWars, worked on new *Transcription* repository

**Thoughts:** Started with a simple exercise to get in the habit of daily practice on CodeWars.

Published new *Transcription* repository that I have been working on.

 Day 1: July 2, 2018

 **Today's Progress:** Practiced on CodeWars, made progress with *Transcription*.

 **Thoughts:** I hope working on CodeWars will help me improve my Python practices.

 The transcription notebook can now export to .xlsx formatted in a way that is very close to the goal output.

Day 2: July 3, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Practiced on CodeWars, more progress with *Transcription*

**Thoughts:** I am enjoying starting with a simple CodeWars exercise to get going. Today's was a reminder of basic array operations.

Trying to figure out how to get transcription notebook to output a properly formatted file. Reading through the docs of xlsxwriter and experimenting with notebook.

Day 3: July 4, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Jumped straight into *Transcription*, continued studying xlsxwriter and experimenting with various formatting options.

**Thoughts:** Transcription notebook almost accomplishes the output goal; presenting strange results from the combination function under certain conditions. I've asked client to send more input examples to figure out what is going wrong.

Day 4: July 5, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Completed a 5 kyu exercise on CodeWars.

**Thoughts:** This is my first 5kyu exercise to complete. This was on array operations and involved recursively examining and removing items from a list if they appeared in particular combinations. It seems like my approach is semi common, but it was really neat to see how some other people solved it with just a few lines. I expected to see a lot of formal recursive functions but haven't come across any.

Day 5: July 6, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Worked on *Transcription*

**Thoughts:** Now have new Design Manager export excel sheet. This time the first column that lists the client has an additional 'project' value after each name. Very frustrated with a bug.

Day 6: July 7, 2018

**Today's Progress:** CodeWars exercises and fiddling with re module

**Thoughts:** Attempting to practice string manipulation and finished one kata but couldn't fork to a simpler solution for some reason. I used re but wanted to try it with just str.translate. Spent a lot of time trying to get something simple to work. Very frustrating but will try again tonight.

Day 7: July 8, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Worked on a notebook exploring optimization using gradient descent.

**Thoughts:** Watching these videos (https://youtu.be/xRJCOz3AfYY) by Siraj Raval for a second time around and plan to make a notebook for each. The theory and math makes sense but am having a hard time following a bug through the initial functions that graph fake data and calculate associated errors.

**Link to work:**
https://github.com/grant-king/The_Math_of_Intelligence/blob/master/week_1/main.ipynb

Day 8: July 9, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Attempting to implement gradient descent, started new course to supplement MOI series.

**Thoughts:** After working through Siraj's first code challenge for a while yesterday and today, I realize that I need some supplemental foundations to my understanding of the theory behind ML. A lot of yesterday's time was spent trying to figure out some nonsense I had written while attempting to implement gradient descent. Today I realized that what I was doing wasn't logical in the first place. I fixed the notebook to make sense, but it is far from finished and I need more background.

I found a course on Coursera called Applied Machine Learning in Python that seems to be right around my current level of understanding. This course has some prerequisites that I have met on DataCamp. It looks like I will be learning about regression in module 2, so expect to be able to complete these MOI coding challenges by then.

**Link to work:**
https://github.com/grant-king/MOI_progress/blob/master/week_1/main.ipynb

Day 9: July 10, 2018

**Today's Progress:**
Finished week 1 in Applied Machine Learning. Followed videos with Jupyter notebook.

**Thoughts:** Applied Machine Learning module 1 was some review but good to go over. It looks like the next module might not get into the mathematic particulars of regression, but more of how to use python to do so easily.

I will take the one that gets more into the math behind these machine learning methods, taught by Andrew Ng and just called 'Machine Learning': https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning. I have heard of this class elsewhere as well, so am encouraged that it is the right choice.

I am going to finish watching lectures for this applied ml course to get a higher-level understanding of what I'm trying to achieve. I expect it will help in Ng's course and working through MOI.

https://github.com/grant-king/MOI_progress/blob/master/week_1/simple_classification.ipynb

Day 10: July 11, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued studying Coursera's Applied Machine Learning. Finished yesterday's notebook and made new Jupyter notebook for this module.

**Thoughts:** Yesterday's notebook was missing the last few lines for the knn classifier to work.

Started watching new lectures and started a new notebook to work through concepts in this module.

**Link to work:**
https://github.com/grant-king/MOI_progress

Day 11: July 12, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Fiddled with datasets from module 2 of Applied Machine Learning.

**Thoughts:** I wish I had more time today to work on module 2. I wanted to zip through but spent time trying to setup all required datasets in notebook. Not all data available on coursera course site will be easily reproducable so may have to look for alternative datasets for some of the example classification problems.

**Link to work:**
https://github.com/grant-king/MOI_progress

Day 12: July 13, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued module 2 of Applied Machine Learning on Coursera

**Thoughts:** Another quick day, but got through making a simple classifier and progress on Module 2. I forgot to update this on this day.

**Link to work:**
https://github.com/grant-king/MOI_progress

Day 13: July 14, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Learned about ridge, lasso, and polynomial regression and normalization in module 2 of Applied Machine Learning Coursera course.

**Thoughts:** Very warm weekend day makes it hard to study, I need to shift schedule to do more at night. I feel like I grasp the logic behind regression algorithms but am still learning something new with each video of the course. This module describes the purpose behind some practices I've learned about for data preparation and feature normalization. The concept employed by Siraj in the beginning of his Math of Intelligence series, of measuring error as a square of sums per model, makes much more sense now. The reasons for measuring a model's total error as a sum of squared errors makes much more sense now.

https://github.com/grant-king/MOI_progress

Day 14: July 15, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued module 2 of Applied Machine Learning Coursera course

**Thoughts:** This course is visiting many semi-familiar concepts and explaining the reasoning behind them. This section covered logistic regression and SVM linear classifiers.

**Link to work:**
https://github.com/grant-king/MOI_progress

Day 15: July 16, 2018

**Today's Progress:** CodeWars practice, continuing through module 2 of Applied Machine Learning Coursera course, continuing DataCamp course on Bokeh library

**Thoughts:** The Coursera course is getting to be a little monotonous so added CodeWars and DataCamp activities today. Coursera is covering multi-class classification using linear models. DataCamp was pleasantly light in comparison and gave me an idea to work on the Transcription notebook as a Bokeh app, but still debating if that would be useful. CodeWars gave a simple word reversing exercise that went quickly.

Day 16: July 17, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Finished module 2 of Applied Machine Learning Coursera course. Continued Bokeh tutorial at DataCamp.

**Thoughts:** I hoped to work on more today, but am glad to be getting through the Coursera course. Bokeh isn't the most exciting thing right now, should work on incorporating something into Transcription notebook tomorrow.

**Link to work:**
https://github.com/grant-king/MOI_progress

Day 17: July 18, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Examining NYC police data for potential project.  Continued Bokeh tutorial on DataCamp.

**Thoughts:** Downloaded 2006 NYC stop and frisk data; planning a potential project that uses some features of this set. 2003-2016 available if features are useful. I should be browsing datasets more regularly to get some intuitive sense of what I could do with each dataset. Didn't work on Transcription today but want to finish Bokeh tutorial first, will then have better idea about what I can improve.

https://github.com/grant-king/MOI_progress

Day 18: July 19, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Reviewed module 2, started on module 3 of Applied Machine Learning Coursera course. Continued Bokeh tutorial at DataCamp.

**Thoughts:** I found an additional resource for module 2 that illustrates how changing certain parameters affects the classification outcome. Added this to week_2 notebook.

**Link to work:**
https://github.com/grant-king/MOI_progress

Day 19: July 20, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Quickly reviewed DataCamp skills with quiz.

**Thoughts:** Not enough time to spend on this today.

**Link to work:**

Day 20: July 21, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continuing in module 3 of Applied Machine Learning at Coursera. Also went back to explore the additional resource and better integrate it into the 'week_2\\SupervisedML' notebook.

**Thoughts:** I want to use Bokeh with this additional resource to help dynamically visualize how tweaking different parameters of each ML method can alter the outcome.

Day 21: July 22, 2018

**Link to work:**
https://github.com/grant-king/MOI_progress

**Today's Progress:** Continued Bokeh tutorial at DataCamp. Continued module 3 of Applied Machine Learning at Coursera.

**Thoughts:** Quick day of studying, worked on how to use Bokeh, to integrate with tools from Coursera course.

**Link to work:**
https://github.com/grant-king/MOI_progress

Day 22: July 23, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued DataCamp tutorial on Bokeh. Began planning how to integrate some bokeh features into *Transcription*.

**Thoughts:** Stuck to Bokeh today to try to get through the last bit.
Have half of the case study left to do there.

**Link to work:**
https://github.com/grant-king/MOI_progress

Day 23: July 24, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Finished Bokeh tutorial and resumed Seaborn tutorial at DataCamp.

**Thoughts:** Bokeh looks very useful but probably not as helpful as I had hoped for using in *Transcription* notebook.

**Link to work:**

Day 24: July 25, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued Seaborn tutorial and restarted statistical thinking course at DataCamp. Researching candidate planning tools.

**Thoughts:** I think that more formal planning would help with coming up with showcase projects and outlining out a clear path for navigating this ML curriculum. I'm hoping to learn a new tool for project planning that could help with this. I found one called Mavenlink and works as an app in Chrome. Changing the plan slightly at this point, I would like to put extra emphasis on finishing the remaining relevant DataCamp courses, and use Coursera Applied Machine Learning to supplement this content until I can confidently approach all concepts required to complete Math Of Intelligence series. After this enroll for Udacity paid certificate for autonomous flight.

I have been staying away from CodeWars or other generalized practice sites for some reason.

**Link to work:**

Day 25: July 26, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Started statistical Thinking in Python at Datacamp. Watched some of Siraj's videos for direction and ideas.

**Thoughts:** I am anxious to get on to more exciting ML projects but feel like I should try to push through the rest of DataCamp lessons as soon as possible. Watching some of Siraj's videos today helped me think more about my curriculum plan; it seems the quickest way to reaching the point where I am comfortable with ML may be through completing my remaining courses on DataCamp. I made a lot of progress in the course today but know my speed of progress will slow down with more difficult content coming up. I want to make daily progress there a priority, and am revising my approach to studying to get through the content more quickly. Once I get through the remainder of this track I should be comfortable enough with the concepts to start working on more tangible projects.

**Link to work:**

Day 26: July 27, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued in Statistical Thinking at DataCamp. Worked in new Mavenlink project planning app to build curriculum plan.

**Thoughts:** Statistical Thinking was slow today. I really like the Mavenlink app for project planning. I've added some DataCamp, Coursera, and YT courses as tasks and milestones in the project I've named 'curriculum'.

**Link to work:**

Day 27: July 28, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued Statistical Thinking at DataCamp

**Thoughts:** I couldn't get through much at DC today. Frustrated by silly mistakes.

Day 28: July 29, 2018

**Today's Progress:**

**Thoughts:** Day off for off day.

**Link to work:**

Day 29: July 30, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued Statistical Thinking at DataCamp

**Thoughts:** Today I finished the 3rd of 4 total modules for the first course of Statistical Thinking in Python at DataCamp. This course has extensively used numpy and np.random and included functions for creating various types of distributed variables. I feel comfortable with basic Statistics but am having a hard time grasping the utility of some of these functons. I may be overcomplicating things and these could just be intentionally vague and general ways to generate randomized data. Hopefully the next section makes this more clear.

**Link to work:**

Day 30: July 31, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued Statistical Thinking at DataCamp. Started investigating side project to add to *Transcription*.

**Thoughts:** Wanted to work on Transcription but ran out of time today. Almost through the first half of Statistical Thinking. After the second half I will be very excited to jump into the ML tutorials at DataCamp and elsewhere.

**Link to work:**

Day 31: August 1, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Briefly worked on Statistical Thinking at DataCamp. Watched some Siraj on different cloud providers and their services.

**Thoughts:** Sluggish on the Statistical Thinking today but very close to through. Siraj has some new videos on cloud providers. I had been keeping an eye on PC parts that might go into an ML build but am very glad to see that all extra computational power can be outsourced. Siraj videos covered some of the many Google Cloud services and AWS. I have also recently seen him do some things with FloydHub, which is apparently better for beginners so probably where I will start.

**Link to work:**

Day 32: August 2, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Finished part 1 of Statistical Thinking and started part 2. Also returned to unfinished Data Visualization in Python at DataCamp.

**Thoughts:** I was happy to get through a good chunk today. I am trying to regularly return to work on to complete any unfinished DataCamp modules, like Data Visualization in Python and the SQL modules that bored me to a halt.  Still itching to start working on actual ML projects. Visualization is fine to learn again now that brain gets used while reviewing theory and statistical operations.

**Link to work:**

Day 33: August 3, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Finished Data Visualization in Python at DataCamp. Continued in Statistical Thinking II. Resumed interactive python textbook "Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures"

**Thoughts:** Happy to get Data Visualization in Python module at DataCamp out of the way. I have been adding more curriculum to the Mavenlink project tracking app to keep perspective on how much I have learned and how far there is to go. I hope to use this app to plan other projects as well. I went back to the interactive python textbook Runestone site and picked up where I left off learning all about how to generate Python classes to represent abstract data types, and various OOP capabilities. I didn't particulaly like the fraction class example offered at Runestone and examples of overriding builtin methods, so I am grateful for youtube and other interactive tutorial sites as lighter alternative examples to solidify these ideas.

Day 34: August 4, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued in Statistical thinking at DataCamp. Continued Runestone interactive textbook, Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures. Researched potential projects using Facebook graph API.

**Thoughts:** Made good progress today and got sidetracked by some ideas about using FB to find names for unlabeled faces. The data seems so accessible I may be missing something that prevents this. I found a list of fb profile URLs from 2010 as an example of publicly accessible data; it looks like people weren't happy with someone making the list. Maybe this vital step of collecting all profile names is now prohibitively difficult? Privacy is probably not something worth putting time into at this point but the research helped me find tools that I can use to get data for other ML projects.

Day 35: August 5, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued at Runestone interactive, finished additional related resources.

**Thoughts:** Finished class review at Runestone and followed several youtube tutorials all about abstract data types in Python. I needed a refresher on how to use classes properly; I finally feel comfortable with the ideas and am excited to start implementing these OOP tools to come up with more sensible code. I should find some CodeWars exercises tomorrow to practice these ideas.

**Link to work:**

Day 36: August 6, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Followed exercises on interactive textbook at python-textbok.readthedocs.io. More review of how classes are implemented in Python.

**Thoughts:** Followed an example exercise for how classes work in Python. Attempting to implement the idea of a music library with classes for album, artist, songs, playlist. Put in repository with infinite monkey exercise from runestone textbook, which I will rename to 'exercises' or something.

**Link to work:**
https://github.com/grant-king/exercises/blob/master/Music_library.ipynb
Day 37: August 7, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Family stuff

**Thoughts:** Day off

**Link to work:**

Day 38: August 8, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued in Statistical Thinking at DataCamp. Watched series on AI in RTS games and another delving further into Python class use. Signed up (again) for improved exercism.io site and browsed some tracks. Researching ML projects, opportunities, and AI applications.

**Thoughts:** Statistical thinking went almost nowhere today. Studying other things proved productive and tried to get a better idea of when/how to make money in this field, this guided by new Siraj video. I'm going back to things that were recently way over my head and am so happy to understand more of the concepts and theory of ML discussed in the instruction. exercism.io has a new site and interface that I may switch to in place of CodeWars.

**Link to work:**

Day 39: August 9, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Followed along videos by Corey on advanced string operations that I certainly need a refresher on. Completed several exercism.io tests.

**Thoughts:** I really like alternating learning sources for these advanced Python topics. A channel by Corey Schafer is a recent discovery for me on YouTube; he has great tutorials on several Python specialties. I think his instruction is generally oriented for software engineers. This is a good alternative to the interactive textbooks I have been working through at Runestone and python-textbok. Today I had fun working through some of the basic exercism.io exercises. I really like this new design and the cli interface they've built. It is easy to download exercises and work on them locally. This is opposed to how I do exercises on CodeWars, always copying instructions into Jupyter and using snippets to solve the problem, then refining back on their site, which provides an environment with inconsistent Python versions.

**Link to work:**

Day 40: August 10, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Worked through a some Kaggle Learn exercises.

**Thoughts:** I don't know why I haven't been working on Kaggle every day; it is an amazingly sleek site and helpful community. I am glad to find more helpful alternatives to supplement my Python data science topics. I am going through their Pandas content.

Day 41: August 11, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Worked through some Kaggle exercises. Finished this Kaggle section. Looked through datasets to use for upcoming projects.

**Thoughts:** I like revisiting the kaggle site now that I know more about how to use Python for EDA.
