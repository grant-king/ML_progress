# 100 Days Of Code - Log
Day 0: July 1, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Practiced on CodeWars, worked on new *Transcription* repository

**Thoughts:** Started with a simple exercise to get in the habit of daily practice on CodeWars.

Published new *Transcription* repository that I have been working on.

 Day 1: July 2, 2018

 **Today's Progress:** Practiced on CodeWars, made progress with *Transcription*.

 **Thoughts:** I hope working on CodeWars will help me improve my Python practices.

 The transcription notebook can now export to .xlsx formatted in a way that is very close to the goal output.

Day 2: July 3, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Practiced on CodeWars, more progress with *Transcription*

**Thoughts:** I am enjoying starting with a simple CodeWars exercise to get going. Today's was a reminder of basic array operations.

Trying to figure out how to get transcription notebook to output a properly formatted file. Reading through the docs of xlsxwriter and experimenting with notebook.

Day 3: July 4, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Jumped straight into *Transcription*, continued studying xlsxwriter and experimenting with various formatting options.

**Thoughts:** Transcription notebook almost accomplishes the output goal; presenting strange results from the combination function under certain conditions. I've asked client to send more input examples to figure out what is going wrong.

https://github.com/grant-king/Transcription

Day 4: July 5, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Completed a 5 kyu exercise on CodeWars.

**Thoughts:** This is my first 5kyu exercise to complete. This was on array operations and involved recursively examining and removing items from a list if they appeared in particular combinations. It seems like my approach is semi common, but it was really neat to see how some other people solved it with just a few lines. I expected to see a lot of formal recursive functions but haven't come across any.

Day 5: July 6, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Worked on *Transcription*

**Thoughts:** Now have new Design Manager export excel sheet. This time the first column that lists the client has an additional 'project' value after each name. Very frustrated with a bug.

https://github.com/grant-king/Transcription

Day 6: July 7, 2018

**Today's Progress:** CodeWars exercises and fiddling with re module

**Thoughts:** Attempting to practice string manipulation and finished one kata but couldn't fork to a simpler solution for some reason. I used re but wanted to try it with just str.translate. Spent a lot of time trying to get something simple to work. Very frustrating but will try again tonight.

Day 7: July 8, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Worked on a notebook exploring optimization using gradient descent.

**Thoughts:** Watching these videos (https://youtu.be/xRJCOz3AfYY) by Siraj Raval for a second time around and plan to make a notebook for each. The theory and math makes sense but am having a hard time following a bug through the initial functions that graph fake data and calculate associated errors.

**Link to work:**
https://github.com/grant-king/The_Math_of_Intelligence/blob/master/week_1/main.ipynb

Day 8: July 9, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Attempting to implement gradient descent, started new course to supplement MOI series.

**Thoughts:** After working through Siraj's first code challenge for a while yesterday and today, I realize that I need some supplemental foundations to my understanding of the theory behind ML. A lot of yesterday's time was spent trying to figure out some nonsense I had written while attempting to implement gradient descent. Today I realized that what I was doing wasn't logical in the first place. I fixed the notebook to make sense, but it is far from finished and I need more background.

I found a course on Coursera called Applied Machine Learning in Python that seems to be right around my current level of understanding. This course has some prerequisites that I have met on DataCamp. It looks like I will be learning about regression in module 2, so expect to be able to complete these MOI coding challenges by then.

**Link to work:**
https://github.com/grant-king/MOI_progress/blob/master/week_1/main.ipynb

Day 9: July 10, 2018

**Today's Progress:**
Finished week 1 in Applied Machine Learning. Followed videos with Jupyter notebook.

**Thoughts:** Applied Machine Learning module 1 was some review but good to go over. It looks like the next module might not get into the mathematic particulars of regression, but more of how to use python to do so easily.

I will take the one that gets more into the math behind these machine learning methods, taught by Andrew Ng and just called 'Machine Learning': https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning. I have heard of this class elsewhere as well, so am encouraged that it is the right choice.

I am going to finish watching lectures for this applied ml course to get a higher-level understanding of what I'm trying to achieve. I expect it will help in Ng's course and working through MOI.

**Link to work:**
https://github.com/grant-king/MOI_progress/blob/master/week_1/simple_classification.ipynb

Day 10: July 11, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued studying Coursera's Applied Machine Learning. Finished yesterday's notebook and made new Jupyter notebook for this module.

**Thoughts:** Yesterday's notebook was missing the last few lines for the knn classifier to work.

Started watching new lectures and started a new notebook to work through concepts in this module.

**Link to work:**
https://github.com/grant-king/MOI_progress

Day 11: July 12, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Fiddled with datasets from module 2 of Applied Machine Learning.

**Thoughts:** I wish I had more time today to work on module 2. I wanted to zip through but spent time trying to setup all required datasets in notebook. Not all data available on coursera course site will be easily reproducable so may have to look for alternative datasets for some of the example classification problems.

**Link to work:**
https://github.com/grant-king/MOI_progress

Day 12: July 13, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued module 2 of Applied Machine Learning on Coursera

**Thoughts:** Another quick day, but got through making a simple classifier and progress on Module 2. I forgot to update this on this day.

**Link to work:**
https://github.com/grant-king/MOI_progress

Day 13: July 14, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Learned about ridge, lasso, and polynomial regression and normalization in module 2 of Applied Machine Learning Coursera course.

**Thoughts:** Very warm weekend day makes it hard to study, I need to shift schedule to do more at night. I feel like I grasp the logic behind regression algorithms but am still learning something new with each video of the course. This module describes the purpose behind some practices I've learned about for data preparation and feature normalization. The concept employed by Siraj in the beginning of his Math of Intelligence series, of measuring error as a square of sums per model, makes much more sense now. The reasons for measuring a model's total error as a sum of squared errors makes much more sense now.

**Link to work:**
https://github.com/grant-king/MOI_progress

Day 14: July 15, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued module 2 of Applied Machine Learning Coursera course

**Thoughts:** This course is visiting many semi-familiar concepts and explaining the reasoning behind them. This section covered logistic regression and SVM linear classifiers.

**Link to work:**
https://github.com/grant-king/MOI_progress

Day 15: July 16, 2018

**Today's Progress:** CodeWars practice, continuing through module 2 of Applied Machine Learning Coursera course, continuing DataCamp course on Bokeh library

**Thoughts:** The Coursera course is getting to be a little monotonous so added CodeWars and DataCamp activities today. Coursera is covering multi-class classification using linear models. DataCamp was pleasantly light in comparison and gave me an idea to work on the Transcription notebook as a Bokeh app, but still debating if that would be useful. CodeWars gave a simple word reversing exercise that went quickly.

https://www.codewars.com/kata/reviews/55401901b8a14241e4000048/groups/5b4d7bd29d2b0bfbf7000fd6

Day 16: July 17, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Finished module 2 of Applied Machine Learning Coursera course. Continued Bokeh tutorial at DataCamp.

**Thoughts:** I hoped to work on more today, but am glad to be getting through the Coursera course. Bokeh isn't the most exciting thing right now, should work on incorporating something into Transcription notebook tomorrow.

**Link to work:**
https://github.com/grant-king/MOI_progress

Day 17: July 18, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Examining NYC police data for potential project.  Continued Bokeh tutorial on DataCamp.

**Thoughts:** Downloaded 2006 NYC stop and frisk data; planning a potential project that uses some features of this set. 2003-2016 available if features are useful. I should be browsing datasets more regularly to get some intuitive sense of what I could do with each dataset. Didn't work on Transcription today but want to finish Bokeh tutorial first, will then have better idea about what I can improve.

**Link to work:**
https://github.com/grant-king/MOI_progress

Day 18: July 19, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Reviewed module 2, started on module 3 of Applied Machine Learning Coursera course. Continued Bokeh tutorial at DataCamp.

**Thoughts:** I found an additional resource for module 2 that illustrates how changing certain parameters affects the classification outcome. Added this to week_2 notebook.

**Link to work:**
https://github.com/grant-king/MOI_progress

Day 19: July 20, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Quickly reviewed DataCamp skills with quiz.

**Thoughts:** Not enough time to spend on this today.

**Link to work:**

Day 20: July 21, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continuing in module 3 of Applied Machine Learning at Coursera. Also went back to explore the additional resource and better integrate it into the 'week_2\\SupervisedML' notebook.

**Thoughts:** I want to use Bokeh with this additional resource to help dynamically visualize how tweaking different parameters of each ML method can alter the outcome.

Day 21: July 22, 2018

**Link to work:**
https://github.com/grant-king/MOI_progress

**Today's Progress:** Continued Bokeh tutorial at DataCamp. Continued module 3 of Applied Machine Learning at Coursera.

**Thoughts:** Quick day of studying, worked on how to use Bokeh, to integrate with tools from Coursera course.

**Link to work:**
https://github.com/grant-king/MOI_progress

Day 22: July 23, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued DataCamp tutorial on Bokeh. Began planning how to integrate some bokeh features into *Transcription*.

**Thoughts:** Stuck to Bokeh today to try to get through the last bit.
Have half of the case study left to do there.

**Link to work:**
https://github.com/grant-king/MOI_progress

Day 23: July 24, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Finished Bokeh tutorial and resumed Seaborn tutorial at DataCamp.

**Thoughts:** Bokeh looks very useful but probably not as helpful as I had hoped for using in *Transcription* notebook.

**Link to work:**

Day 24: July 25, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued Seaborn tutorial and restarted statistical thinking course at DataCamp. Researching candidate planning tools.

**Thoughts:** I think that more formal planning would help with coming up with showcase projects and outlining out a clear path for navigating this ML curriculum. I'm hoping to learn a new tool for project planning that could help with this. I found one called Mavenlink and works as an app in Chrome. Changing the plan slightly at this point, I would like to put extra emphasis on finishing the remaining relevant DataCamp courses, and use Coursera Applied Machine Learning to supplement this content until I can confidently approach all concepts required to complete Math Of Intelligence series. After this enroll for Udacity paid certificate for autonomous flight.

I have been staying away from CodeWars or other generalized practice sites for some reason.

**Link to work:**

Day 25: July 26, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Started statistical Thinking in Python at Datacamp. Watched some of Siraj's videos for direction and ideas.

**Thoughts:** I am anxious to get on to more exciting ML projects but feel like I should try to push through the rest of DataCamp lessons as soon as possible. Watching some of Siraj's videos today helped me think more about my curriculum plan; it seems the quickest way to reaching the point where I am comfortable with ML may be through completing my remaining courses on DataCamp. I made a lot of progress in the course today but know my speed of progress will slow down with more difficult content coming up. I want to make daily progress there a priority, and am revising my approach to studying to get through the content more quickly. Once I get through the remainder of this track I should be comfortable enough with the concepts to start working on more tangible projects.

**Link to work:**

Day 26: July 27, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued in Statistical Thinking at DataCamp. Worked in new Mavenlink project planning app to build curriculum plan.

**Thoughts:** Statistical Thinking was slow today. I really like the Mavenlink app for project planning. I've added some DataCamp, Coursera, and YT courses as tasks and milestones in the project I've named 'curriculum'.

**Link to work:**

Day 27: July 28, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued Statistical Thinking at DataCamp

**Thoughts:** I couldn't get through much at DC today. Frustrated by silly mistakes.

**Link to work:**

Day 28: July 29, 2018

**Today's Progress:**

**Thoughts:** Day off for off day.

**Link to work:**

Day 29: July 30, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued Statistical Thinking at DataCamp

**Thoughts:** Today I finished the 3rd of 4 total modules for the first course of Statistical Thinking in Python at DataCamp. This course has extensively used numpy and np.random and included functions for creating various types of distributed variables. I feel comfortable with basic Statistics but am having a hard time grasping the utility of some of these functons. I may be overcomplicating things and these could just be intentionally vague and general ways to generate randomized data. Hopefully the next section makes this more clear.

**Link to work:**

Day 30: July 31, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued Statistical Thinking at DataCamp. Started investigating side project to add to *Transcription*.

**Thoughts:** Wanted to work on Transcription but ran out of time today. Almost through the first half of Statistical Thinking. After the second half I will be very excited to jump into the ML tutorials at DataCamp and elsewhere.

**Link to work:**

Day 31: August 1, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Briefly worked on Statistical Thinking at DataCamp. Watched some Siraj on different cloud providers and their services.

**Thoughts:** Sluggish on the Statistical Thinking today but very close to through. Siraj has some new videos on cloud providers. I had been keeping an eye on PC parts that might go into an ML build but am very glad to see that all extra computational power can be outsourced. Siraj videos covered some of the many Google Cloud services and AWS. I have also recently seen him do some things with FloydHub, which is apparently better for beginners so probably where I will start.

**Link to work:**

Day 32: August 2, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Finished part 1 of Statistical Thinking and started part 2. Also returned to unfinished Data Visualization in Python at DataCamp.

**Thoughts:** I was happy to get through a good chunk today. I am trying to regularly return to work on to complete any unfinished DataCamp modules, like Data Visualization in Python and the SQL modules that bored me to a halt.  Still itching to start working on actual ML projects. Visualization is fine to learn again now that brain gets used while reviewing theory and statistical operations.

**Link to work:**

Day 33: August 3, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Finished Data Visualization in Python at DataCamp. Continued in Statistical Thinking II. Resumed interactive python textbook "Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures"

**Thoughts:** Happy to get Data Visualization in Python module at DataCamp out of the way. I have been adding more curriculum to the Mavenlink project tracking app to keep perspective on how much I have learned and how far there is to go. I hope to use this app to plan other projects as well. I went back to the interactive python textbook Runestone site and picked up where I left off learning all about how to generate Python classes to represent abstract data types, and various OOP capabilities. I didn't particulaly like the fraction class example offered at Runestone and examples of overriding builtin methods, so I am grateful for youtube and other interactive tutorial sites as lighter alternative examples to solidify these ideas.

Day 34: August 4, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued in Statistical thinking at DataCamp. Continued Runestone interactive textbook, Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures. Researched potential projects using Facebook graph API.

**Thoughts:** Made good progress today and got sidetracked by some ideas about using FB to find names for unlabeled faces. The data seems so accessible I may be missing something that prevents this. I found a list of fb profile URLs from 2010 as an example of publicly accessible data; it looks like people weren't happy with someone making the list. Maybe this vital step of collecting all profile names is now prohibitively difficult? Privacy is probably not something worth putting time into at this point but the research helped me find tools that I can use to get data for other ML projects.

Day 35: August 5, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued at Runestone interactive, finished additional related resources.

**Thoughts:** Finished class review at Runestone and followed several youtube tutorials all about abstract data types in Python. I needed a refresher on how to use classes properly; I finally feel comfortable with the ideas and am excited to start implementing these OOP tools to come up with more sensible code. I should find some CodeWars exercises tomorrow to practice these ideas.

**Link to work:**

Day 36: August 6, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Followed exercises on interactive textbook at python-textbok.readthedocs.io. More review of how classes are implemented in Python.

**Thoughts:** Followed an example exercise for how classes work in Python. Attempting to implement the idea of a music library with classes for album, artist, songs, playlist. Put in repository with infinite monkey exercise from runestone textbook, which I will rename to 'exercises' or something.

**Link to work:**
https://github.com/grant-king/exercises/blob/master/Music_library.ipynb
Day 37: August 7, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Family stuff

**Thoughts:** Day off

**Link to work:**

Day 38: August 8, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued in Statistical Thinking at DataCamp. Watched series on AI in RTS games and another delving further into Python class use. Signed up (again) for improved exercism.io site and browsed some tracks. Researching ML projects, opportunities, and AI applications.

**Thoughts:** Statistical thinking went almost nowhere today. Studying other things proved productive and tried to get a better idea of when/how to make money in this field, this guided by new Siraj video. I'm going back to things that were recently way over my head and am so happy to understand more of the concepts and theory of ML discussed in the instruction. exercism.io has a new site and interface that I may switch to in place of CodeWars.

**Link to work:**

Day 39: August 9, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Followed along videos by Corey on advanced string operations that I certainly need a refresher on. Completed several exercism.io tests.

**Thoughts:** I really like alternating learning sources for these advanced Python topics. A channel by Corey Schafer is a recent discovery for me on YouTube; he has great tutorials on several Python specialties. I think his instruction is generally oriented for software engineers. This is a good alternative to the interactive textbooks I have been working through at Runestone and python-textbok. Today I had fun working through some of the basic exercism.io exercises. I really like this new design and the cli interface they've built. It is easy to download exercises and work on them locally. This is opposed to how I do exercises on CodeWars, always copying instructions into Jupyter and using snippets to solve the problem, then refining back on their site, which provides an environment with inconsistent Python versions.

**Link to work:**

Day 40: August 10, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Worked through a some Kaggle Learn exercises.

**Thoughts:** I don't know why I haven't been working on Kaggle every day; it is an amazingly sleek site and helpful community. I am glad to find more helpful alternatives to supplement my Python data science topics. I am going through their Pandas content.


**Link to work:**
https://kaggle.com/grking/creating-reading-and-writing-workbook

https://www.kaggle.com/grking/indexing-selecting-assigning

Day 41: August 11, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Worked through some Kaggle exercises. Finished this Kaggle section. Looked through datasets to use for upcoming projects.

**Thoughts:** I like revisiting the kaggle site now that I know more about how to use Python for EDA.

**Link to work:**
https://www.kaggle.com/grking/indexing-selecting-assigning?scriptVersionId=5048943

Day 42: August 12, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Returned to Statistical Thinking at DataCamp. Started "Supervised Learning with scikit-learn" course.

**Thoughts:** I was avoiding DataCamp for the current Statistical Thinking II course. Tried to return but it was difficult to progress through it without just getting through it. Although the material is familiar from my theoretical understanding of stats, I'm having a hard time figuring out the purpose of some exercises and why the instructor is explaining something that seems simple & familiar in such a convoluted way. I Decided to come back to that topic later and start in on the ML content. I had taken about half of the first chapter 6mo ago or so, so I restarted my course progress. Again I am noticing that some familiar topics are explained in a way that isn't as helpful as how I would like to hear them explained, so I plan to work through the nearly-parallel Applied Machine Learning course at Coursera to supplement the theory part.

DataCamp is good to quickly get going with many libraries but I need to remember to treat it as an incredibly helpful Python library reference and not something that will explain why I'm doing the things it is showing me how to do.

**Link to work:**

Day 43: August 13, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Exercism practice. Researching YouTube Data API.

**Thoughts:** There are a lot of good exercism exercises for me to try. Also working on project for YouTube API, planning to use to perform nlp with video captions or possibly with comments. Will likely have new repository for that soon.

**Link to work:**

Day 44: August 14, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Worked with Twitter API. Followed Siraj Video.

**Thoughts:** There is very little documentation or examples for this API and Python tweepy library so this is frustrating. I got it to connect, authenticate, and return a search query. I'm not putting it on GitHub as it has my authentication keys.

**Link to work:**

Day 45: August 15, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Experimented with Twitter API. Found some additional Python libraries that work with it. Continued with Supervised Learning at DataCamp.

**Thoughts:** The Twitter API is pretty restrictive. Searches can only go back a week for non-premium API accounts like mine. I got through the basics involving authentication and searching for a topic, and worked with some of the available methods from tweepy and Twython. I can see this being helpful in the future if I ever need to look for something simple in recent Twitter data. For now the API is underwhelming but I'm glad to be familiar with how to access the service.

**Link to work:**
Day 46: August 16, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Twitter API experimentation. Watched Siraj live stream on gradient descent and explored notebook for week one challenge of MOI.

**Thoughts:** Today I went back to explore the old notebook for Math of Intelligence week 1 coding challenge. It all makes a lot more sense than before and I think I can rewrite and implement somewhere. I want to look at datasets on Kaggle to see what to use.

**Link to work:**

Day 47: August, 17 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued working with tweepy in unpublished notebook. Worked on exercism.io, researching Django through Sentdex on YouTube, continued researching Youtube API.

**Thoughts:** I keep going back to add onto my notebook about the Twitter libraries and API, but I'm still seeing limited use for anything in the near future. I think that learning to work with the YouTube API will be more worthwhile considering the data they make available. Django doesn't seem like something I should pursue for now either.


**Link to work:**
Day 48: August 18, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Researched Flask. Continued on exercism.io

**Thoughts:** Found a series on YouTube by Corey Schafer about Flask. I really like the Exercism exercises.

**Link to work:**

Day 49: August 19, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued on exercism.io

**Thoughts:** Just did these practice exercises Today. It is really helpful.

**Link to work:**

Day 50: August 20, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Exploring datasets on Kaggle. Continued in Supervised Learning at DataCamp

**Thoughts:** I need to get back on track working daily at DataCamp and get the career track off the list so I can move on. After this I think that it would be a good idea to find another paid course, likely one of the automated transportation courses at Udacity.

**Link to work:**

Day 51: August 21, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued Supervised Learning at DataCamp

**Thoughts:**

Day 52: August 22, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Started new video series by Siraj.

**Thoughts:** I found an older video series by Siraj covering Python for data science. It starts with scikit learn so seems to be at the right level. I don't see why I couldn't do this concurrently with the MOI series but I think that I will have more perspective if I do this first. Completed the first coding challenge.

**Link to work:**
https://github.com/grant-king/ML_progress/blob/master/PDS_challenges/week_1.ipynb

Day 53: August 23, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Kaggle Pandas exercises. More experimentation with YouTube API.

**Thoughts:**

Day 54: August 24, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued captions project with YouTube API. Continued with Kaggle Pandas exercises.

**Thoughts:** Some of the code samples on the YouTube Python API documentation is outdated and won't run in Python 3. There aren't any examples clear enough to recreate easily so I am trying to convert the whole script to Python 3 in order to debug and have a better idea of what is happening.

Day 55: August 25, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Exercism exercises. Continued in Supervised Machine Learning at DataCamp. Revisiting mortality dataset parsing project in local folder, downloaded new mortality data from CDC interface.

**Thoughts:** I downloaded cause of death data from the CDC interface at https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/datarequest/D77. I found a folder called mortality data in my python project folder, so put the data there. The downloaded data seems like it might already be in this file with accompanying scripts to work with it. I have almost no memory of writing these. I want to upload the data and my analysis to Kaggle when I have it in a form that is easier to inspect.

Day 56: August 26, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued mortality dataset investigation. Completed second coding challenge for Python for Data Science YouTube series.

**Thoughts:** The mortality dataset that I downloaded is not what I was wanting. Preparing that dataset might be a task for later when I need to figure out complicated imports. I followed week 2 video for PDS series and completed the coding challenge. This was a simple sentiment analysis using tweepy and textblob.

**Link to work:**
https://github.com/grant-king/ML_progress/blob/master/PDS_challenges/week_2.ipynb

Day 57: August 27, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued in Supervised Learning at DataCamp. Explored Cannabis Reports API documentation and Python wrapper.

**Thoughts:** Supervised Learning at DataCamp seems to be a good background activity for in betwix less guided projects. I Found a very exciting dataset prospect with the Cannabis Reports API.  https://developers.cannabisreports.com/v1.0/docs I'm not exactly sure where i'm going with it but have requested an API key to start exploring the dataset outside of their interface, with the help of a Python wrapper. The wrapper seems like it isn't being maintained so this could be a good opportunity to contribute to that library.

Day 58: August 28, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Added two new methods to week_2 notebook that allows for getting tweets by user; with and without authentication. Experimented with pillow to get image geotag. Continued in Supervised Learning at DataCamp. Rediscovered nlp course and started prerequisite at DataCamp.

**Thoughts:** I feel better about working with the Twitter API. Expeimenting with finding geotags in photos.  

Day 59: August 29, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Worked through week 3 of PDS. Started week 4. Continued NLP Fundamentals in Python at DataCamp. Kaggle.

**Thoughts:** Spent unnecessary time trying to figure out a bug in a kernel on Kaggle. In general browsing all of the datasets on there is getting to be more fun than frustrating, which is nice.  Week 3 of python for data science is fairly straightforward but I will come back to complete it when I need practice like that. The instructions are a little vague so try to see how others completed. Week 4 is ok but theory is hard to connect to how behind-the-scenes works to apply to this particular problem. Also, 'slightly better than random' isn't something I want to spend too much time trying to understand the intricacies of how it functions.  I'm excited to get to next week so will do the minimum and move on.

Day 60: August 30, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Started week 5 of the Python for Data Science series. Continued with NLP Fundamentals. Researching job opportunities.

**Thoughts:** Excited with everything.

Day 62: September 1, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Worked with infinite-monkey repository and made script to make text file into tts mp3

**Thoughts:** Not directly related to studies, but good to have.

Day 63: September 2, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued with Fundamentals of NLP at DataCamp. Continued with Pandas maps workbook on Kaggle.

**Thoughts:** Not a ton of time to work on stuff today but am glad to get the practice in. I am bouncing between a few courses lately but not making great headway in them. I need to figure out if focused tenacity or distract and return is a better plan there.

Day 64: September 3, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued with NLP Fundamentals at DataCamp.

Day 65: September 4, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued with NLP Fundamentals at DataCamp.

Day 66: September 5, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued with NLP Fundamentals and Supervised Learning at DataCamp.  

**Thoughts:** Researching remote contract jobs, signed up with freelancer as it seems like a slightly easier site to find relevant job postings, compared to upwork.

Day 67: September 6, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued with Supervised Learning at DataCamp. Followed tutorial and published a simple app to Google Cloud Platform.

**Thoughts:** Trying to figure out a way to publish app using script in Transcription repository as a test. GCP was easy enough when following the tutorial but I will look elsewhere for something that is more straightforward for this simple project. Google Cloud seems like it would be a great option for hosting a large project that requires significant resources.

Day 68: September 7, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Followed Heroku tutorial and published simple Django app to their service.  

**Thoughts:** I want to get Transcription online so that someone can use it from their work and I can go through the motions of publishing and maintaining an app. I'd like to get comfortable with using some cloud provider to showcase work, likely Heroku, before moving on from DataCamp studies. I will certainly have more interest in learning about postgresql and databases when I go back to those courses there.

Day 69: September 8, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Django introduction tutorials one and two at djangoproject.com. Scrapy introduction at scrapy.org.

**Thoughts:** Going through the Django tutorials on their main site. Tutorials are working so far but some of the content goes beyond what I want to spend time learning about right now. I am able to gloss over some things here without forfeiting much utility. Scrapy is a web scraping framework that was mentioned on awesome-django.com resource list, I think will be extremely useful.

Day 70: September 9, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Second and third Django introduction tutorials.

**Thoughts:** This is doing more than I want to with Django right now but I hope breezing through the more-advanced steps in the tutorial will at least give me a better understanding of how things work within the framework.

Day 71: September 10, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Part 1 and 2 Django beginner's tutorial at simpleisbetterthancomplex.

**Thoughts:** The third Django introduction tutorial at the Django official documentation got to be more abstract than I was comfortable with. I switched over to a more detailed explanation at this simpleisbetterthancomplex blog. I really like the tutorial and will continue making the sample discussion board app.

Day 72: September 11, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued Django tutorial at simpleisbetterthancomplex

**Thoughts:** This Django tutorial is moving along, although I got caught up trying to restart everything after changing an unrelated Windows setting. I am glad to have installed Django in an Anaconda environment as it was very easy to create another environment, repeat all my steps and realize where the error was. Complicating this discovery was another error having to do with a required keyword argument in the ForeignKey method within models definition file. the method was missing a now-required on_delete argument, here corrected for example: models.ForeignKey(User, related_name='topics', on_delete=models.CASCADE)

Day 72: September 12, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued Django tutorial at simpleisbetterthancomplex

**Thoughts:** Now learning about testing features in second Django tutorial. Django's template system looks like it will be very useful as well.

Day 73: September 13, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued Django tutorial and finished second installment. Started part 3.

Day 74: September 14, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Researched serial number analysis methods and implemented in pyhton.

**Thoughts:** Added a notebook with this script to exercises repository. I don't have enough serial numbers to test what I made this for yet but it seems like it will work when I do.

Day 75: September 15, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued with third Django tutorial at simpleisbetterthancomplex.

**Thoughts:** This segment is covering how Django handles URL routing and how to use tests.
