# 100 Days Of Code - Log
Day 0: July 1, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Practiced on CodeWars, worked on new *Transcription* repository

**Thoughts:** Started with a simple exercise to get in the habit of daily practice on CodeWars.

Published new *Transcription* repository that I have been working on.

 Day 1: July 2, 2018

 **Today's Progress:** Practiced on CodeWars, made progress with *Transcription*.

 **Thoughts:** I hope working on CodeWars will help me improve my Python practices.

 The transcription notebook can now export to .xlsx formatted in a way that is very close to the goal output.

Day 2: July 3, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Practiced on CodeWars, more progress with *Transcription*

**Thoughts:** I am enjoying starting with a simple CodeWars exercise to get going. Today's was a reminder of basic array operations.

Trying to figure out how to get transcription notebook to output a properly formatted file. Reading through the docs of xlsxwriter and experimenting with notebook.

Day 3: July 4, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Jumped straight into *Transcription*, continued studying xlsxwriter and experimenting with various formatting options.

**Thoughts:** Transcription notebook almost accomplishes the output goal; presenting strange results from the combination function under certain conditions. I've asked client to send more input examples to figure out what is going wrong.

Day 4: July 5, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Completed a 5 kyu exercise on CodeWars.

**Thoughts:** This is my first 5kyu exercise to complete. This was on array operations and involved recursively examining and removing items from a list if they appeared in particular combinations. It seems like my approach is semi common, but it was really neat to see how some other people solved it with just a few lines. I expected to see a lot of formal recursive functions but haven't come across any.

Day 5: July 6, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Worked on *Transcription*

**Thoughts:** Now have new Design Manager export excel sheet. This time the first column that lists the client has an additional 'project' value after each name. Very frustrated with a bug.

Day 6: July 7, 2018

**Today's Progress:** CodeWars exercises and fiddling with re module

**Thoughts:** Attempting to practice string manipulation and finished one kata but couldn't fork to a simpler solution for some reason. I used re but wanted to try it with just str.translate. Spent a lot of time trying to get something simple to work. Very frustrating but will try again tonight.

Day 7: July 8, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Worked on a notebook exploring optimization using gradient descent.

**Thoughts:** Watching these videos (https://youtu.be/xRJCOz3AfYY) by Siraj Raval for a second time around and plan to make a notebook for each. The theory and math makes sense but am having a hard time following a bug through the initial functions that graph fake data and calculate associated errors.

Day 8: July 9, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Attempting to implement gradient descent, started new course to supplement MOI series.

**Thoughts:** After working through Siraj's first code challenge for a while yesterday and today, I realize that I need some supplemental foundations to my understanding of the theory behind ML. A lot of yesterday's time was spent trying to figure out some nonsense I had written while attempting to implement gradient descent. Today I realized that what I was doing wasn't logical in the first place. I fixed the notebook to make sense, but it is far from finished and I need more background.

I found a course on Coursera called Applied Machine Learning in Python that seems to be right around my current level of understanding. This course has some prerequisites that I have met on DataCamp. It looks like I will be learning about regression in module 2, so expect to be able to complete these MOI coding challenges by then.

Day 9: July 10, 2018

**Today's Progress:**
Finished week 1 in Applied Machine Learning. Followed videos with Jupyter notebook.

**Thoughts:** Applied Machine Learning module 1 was some review but good to go over. It looks like the next module might not get into the mathematic particulars of regression, but more of how to use python to do so easily.

I will take the one that gets more into the math behind these machine learning methods, taught by Andrew Ng and just called 'Machine Learning': https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning. I have heard of this class elsewhere as well, so am encouraged that it is the right choice.

I am going to finish watching lectures for this applied ml course to get a higher-level understanding of what I'm trying to achieve. I expect it will help in Ng's course and working through MOI.

Day 10: July 11, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued studying Coursera's Applied Machine Learning. Finished yesterday's notebook and made new Jupyter notebook for this module.

**Thoughts:** Yesterday's notebook was missing the last few lines for the knn classifier to work.

Started watching new lectures and started a new notebook to work through concepts in this module.

Day 11: July 12, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Fiddled with datasets from module 2 of Applied Machine Learning.

**Thoughts:** I wish I had more time today to work on module 2. I wanted to zip through but spent time trying to setup all required datasets in notebook. Not all data available on coursera course site will be easily reproducable so may have to look for alternative datasets for some of the example classification problems.

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
