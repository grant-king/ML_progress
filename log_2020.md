# 2020 Log Record
This is a projects and learning progress log for this year. 

### March 23, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Started Intro to Computer Vision Lesson 22 on Udacity. Started Image Processing in Python at DataCamp. 

**Notes** The ICV course has been so dense for the last several lessons. It is hard to figure out how I could apply the theory they are trudging through, but I know there are gems here and there as long as I don't break my brain trying to comprehend this flyby of so much math that I don't easily understand.

I'm starting a course at datacamp, [Image Processing in Python](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/image-processing-in-python). It looks like it can offer some useful imaging techniques while I wait for the other course to level out. 

### March 20, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued PCA updates.

### March 19, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued PCA updates.

**Notes** Today working on more performance monitor updates, adding new grid options for setting processing mode, as well as color and visualization options. I'm adding a couple of new examples to explore these new optons.

### March 18, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued PCA updates. Continued IPC lesson 3.

**Notes** I'm having a hard time with logging working the way I want it to work. It is easiest to ditch the logging module and set up my own simple logging with a method in the performance monitoring models. I've also been able to streamline and upgrade those models today.

### March 17, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued IPC lesson 3. Finished last two sections of the functional programming tutorial at Real Python. Begin PCA updates.

**Notes** It seems like there will be a lot of residual optimizing and tidying from the refactor, but for the most part I can start working on other updates.

Today I'm adding a way to switch between processing modes, and looking at improvments to the performance monitoring models. I need a better way to store performance metrics in order to be able to review how code changes are affecting things. Logging seems like too much of a headache to configure for what I want, and may be the source for some slowdown. 

### March 16, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished the first part of the CUDA implementation phase for PCA refactor.

**Notes** I've been trying to get to this milestone for months, it seems. It has been purely frustrating for the last week, so I am extremely relived to be to this point now. Now CUDA is successfully, albeit shakily implemented. It runs so much faster than before. I don't have to record and replay them to observe large grids. I will have to make many more optimizations before I can realize the full speed potential.

The next steps will be much easier to do. I need to continue to optimize the CUDA portions, convert sporadic numpy operations to CUDA equivalents, implement multiprocessing on the CPU end to mitigate all of the CPU-bound bottlenecks, and do other obvious performance improvents. Now that these can be run in real-time, I can slowly chip away at those things as I find them, in-between adding the next features.

### March 13, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued IPC lesson 3. Continued NVIDIA course parts 2 and 3. Continued CUDA implementation for PCA.

### March 12, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued IPC lesson 3. Started CUDA implementation phase for PCA refactor. Started NVIDIA couse parts 2 and 3.

### March 11, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished IPC lesson 1. Started IPC lesson 3. 

**Notes** Skipping lesson 2 interview for now.

### March 10, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued IPC lesson 1. Continued Nvidia course, part 1.

**Notes** I'm working on the problem set for this first lesson. I'm stuck on a strange error that I can't figure out. It is difficult to debug what's going wrong with the CUDA portion. It is difficult to debug in Jupyter notebooks in general; I'm going to do the problem sets in a separate file for working on in VS Code.

### March 9, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued Intro to Parallel Computing, lesson 1. Continued Nvidia course, part 1.

**Notes** I'm documenting IPC course progress in a notebook, like i'm doing for the ICV course. Also like in that course, I'm attempting to translate this course's non-Python stuff into Python stuff. 

This course uses CUDA C, so I'm following the Nvidia couse notebooks and other resources to help translate the course examples into CUDA Python equivalents.

### March 6, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued PCA refactor.

**Notes** This first part of the refactor is done. Simulation is running like it was, but using new methods that operate on the grid as a whole, rather than on individual cells. 

These methods still operate on one cell at a time, so I didn't expect a lot of speedup. For larger grids this approach has sped things up slightly, though, something like 3-6x. I think most of this is because the new methods use and operate on large numpy arrays, rather than having to operate on many more, much smaller numpy arrays.

### March 5, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued PCA refactor.

### March 4, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued PCA refactor.

### March 3, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued PCA refactor.

### March 2, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued PCA refactor.

**Notes** I don't want to change too much with the code, too quickly. I know that it will be easy to break things so that it is difficult to find where things are broken, and waste time. The code is fairly convoluted in some areas and is not easy to debug.

### February 28, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued PCA refactor.

**Notes** There is a lot of work to do for this refactor. I'm not sure how things got to be this convoluted, but it needs a lot of rearranging before I will be able to test the new methods that calculate next steps from a snapshot of grid states.

### February 27, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued PCA refactor.

### February 26, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued NVIDIA course, part 1. Started refactor on Python Cellular Automata ca_models.py. 

**Notes** I think I know enough about the basics to figure out how to rearrange the models in my Python-cellular-automata repository to be able to compute in parallel on the GPU. I think a slow, gradual refactor to an overall more functional approach will be easier than forking. 

### February 25, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished ICV lesson 21. Continued IPC lesson 1. Started NVIDIA course Fundamentals of Accelerated Computing with CUDA Python notebook 1 of 3.

**Notes** This paid NVIDIA course should get me on the right track to knowing which CUDA Python implementation will be most useful for completing the challenges in the Udacity Introduction to Parallel Computing with CUDA C course. 

### February 24, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued IPC lesson 1. Continued Functional Programming in Python at Real Python. 

**Notes** This Intro to Parallel Computing course is using C CUDA, but I want to use Python tools. I'm trying to find the right Python libraries to use.

**Notes** Course Link:  https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud810

### January 17, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished ICV Lesson 6. Finished Lesson 7.

**Notes** I am happy to see the math behind useful edge detection methods. It is neat to see the output from the Sorbel filters. I am just using built in Canny method without recreating the entire process for Lesson 7. 

### January 16, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued ICV Lesson 6. 

### January 15, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Started ICV Lesson 6 lectures.

**Notes** This lesson focuses on finding lines by calculating image gradients. It reviews some basic concepts of multivariate calculus and shows how partial derivatives can be used to determine the locations of lines in an image. The calculus is very straightforward so far.

### January 14, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished ICV Lesson 4 activities. Finished Lesson 5 lectures.

**Notes** I feel good about some newly developed techniques from the lesson 4 challenges. I am through with all of the lesson 5 lectures, but will probably rewatch when I do activities. I still need to complete the template filtering challenges, but am anxious to see other operations now. I will get back to the code as soon as lectures are a little less consumable.

### January 13, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued Lesson 4 for Introduction to Computer Vision from Georgia Tech on Udacity.

**Notes** Recreating the course material in Python feels appropriately suited to my capabilities. The operations on images are still pretty straightforward and logically simple; the challenge is preparing input data and then implementing the operations in Python while limiting myself from using certain prebuilt tools. I feel like this is the best route to being the most appropriately experiened for the things I want to do after this course. 

I am looking forward to making time for projects this week, I think that some of what I have used for filtering challenges could be useful in the PCA project.

### January 10, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued ICV lesson 4.

### January 9, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued Intro to Compuuter Vision Lesson 3.

### January 6, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued Intro to Computer Vision. Finished Lesson 2, Started Lesson 3.

**Notes** As an added benefit, I am getting good practice with some very useful numpy methods while trying to translate this course's challenges into Python code.

### January 2, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued Intro to Computer Vision. Started Lesson 2.

**Notes:** This lesson covers some very basic operations on image arrays. Here is the file for notes: https://github.com/grant-king/report/blob/master/ICV_challenges/IntroCV_notes.ipynb.
The course uses Matlab but the equivalents are easy enough to convert to OpenCV with Python. I think these first lessons have to start slow; so far everything seems simple and familiar.

### January 1, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Started Georgia Tech Intro to Computer Vision: https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud810. Completed Lesson 1.

**Notes:** This Udiacity computer vision course is broken up into about 70 lessons.
