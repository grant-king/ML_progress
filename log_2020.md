# 2020 Log Record
This is a projects and learning progress log for this year.

### September 11, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Completed DCP lesson 2, 3, 4, 5. 

**Notes:** These lessons were much smaller.

### September 10, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished DCP lesson 1, Started lesson 2. 

### September 9, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued DCP lesson 1. Continued Django PCA interface project.

**Notes:** I'm on the fence about this instructor. Again here is another course I'm glad I'm taking too late, because if I had taken it on time I wouldn't be able to see the things that make understanding this material unnecessarilyÂ difficult. Instead, at this stage it is a lot easier to spot these things and avoid wasting energy.

### September 4, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued DCP lesson 1. PCA upgrades.

**Notes:** This first lesson is walking through how to design a simple program to simulate Poker. 

### September 3, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished ICV lesson 38. Continued DCP lesson 1. 

**Notes:** This is the next lesson on motion in ICV. So far it is mostly about how limited gradient-based optical flow calculations are on their own, without extra constraints. I think the theme for a lot of this course could be: neat concepts supported by dense equations that are ultimately limited in practice. 

### September 2, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Started lesson 1 for Design of Computer Programs course on Udacity. Started ICV lesson 38.

**Notes:** I'm taking this new DCP course to make sure I have a firm foundation in the problem solving aspects of program design. DCP only has 22 lessons and I think most of it should be review. I think I have already covered a lot of this piece by piece, but it will be nice to fill in missing parts in my understanding and reinforce everything with a cohesive course. I know I have some conceptual holes that will be hard to fill otherwise; this course seems like the most efficient approach. Hopefully completing this course will also help me figure out how to learn the next layer of this stuff. I probably should have taken this course when I was doing the Rice specialization last year. I think it will be easy enough to make the exercises appropriate for whatever skill level I'm at now.

### September 1, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Restarted, completed ICV lesson 37. Attempting to find new software development courses.

**Notes:** I've had a long break from this intro to computer vision course, but it is time to get back to it. I've restarted the first lesson of this unit on motion.

I really need to learn more about certain aspects of software development, so that I can learn how to build larger systems. I've found a specialization on Coursera and a course or two on Udacity that should be a good start for figuring out where I am with this.

### August 31, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued Django PCA interface project. PCA upgrades.

**Notes:** I've added a few more views and am continuing to flesh out the back end. I want to move on to getting minimal templates in place for these current views so that I can work with the context object from within the structured html of the template file instead of trying to messily unpack objects into a long html string, directly in the view function. I want to do this before moving on to using any class-based views or adding additional views that need forms.

For PCA upgrades, I'm trying to add timer setting methods for the API, and some other methods that will also avoid the input prompt cycle used by the CLI. Part of this is just refactoring methods that both handle and use input into separate tasks, which I probably should have been doing this whole time.

### August 28, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued Django PCA interface project. PCA upgrades. 

**Notes:** I'm starting to add some additional views for this interface project.

Working on the Django CA interface is helping to highlight a bunch of shortcomings in the PCA API. It is providing me with a growing list of features that I need to work on adding.

### August 27, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued Django PCA interface project.

### August 26, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued Django PCA interface project. 

### August 25, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued DJango PCA interface project. 

**Notes:** I think Celery is going to take some time to learn about and integrate. For now I'll make that feature less of an immediate priority and start fleshing out a few basic views first. 

### August 24, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued Django PCA interface project. 

**Notes:** The app now has very basic functionality. It is able to start a new PCA sim session by visiting a specific route. The page only responds when the simulation is complete though, because the view can't return a response until the PCA session is finished. I think I need to implement some sort of asynchronous setup so that routes can return while the PCA session is still running and capturing input. Now I'm figuring out how to use something called Celery for this.

### August 21, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Started Django PCA interface project. 

**Notes:** I've started a new django project that I'm hoping can provide a graphical interface to PCA. I'm able to import the PCA project after installing it in development mode. I'm glad I was able to install it like this, as I don't have to repackage or reinstall anything after I make upgrades to PCA, the changes are immediately applied to this other project where it is being imported. 

### August 20, 2020

**Today's Progress:** PCA upgrades.

**Notes:** I'm wrapping up all of the vital updates needed before publishing. I've noticed that there is a much better approach than publicly publishing the package for the stage I'm at; I can just install the package in editable or development mode without doing anything extra by using pip install with the -e flag.

### August 19, 2020

**Today's Progress:** PCA upgrades.

**Notes:** More upgrades and updates in preparation for publishing. I've removed all of the old example files and other clutter like ui files form when I was making a Qt interface. The main script is now just called main, and can be used to start up the CLI. 

### August 18, 2020

**Today's Progress:** PCA upgrades.

**Notes:** Continued fleshing out session_models classes. Added functionality for starting a new session from the default or custom configuration files.

### August 17, 2020

**Today's Progress:** PCA upgrades.

**Notes:** Continued working on higher-level models for taking care of all aspects of setting up a new simulation. There are three models for this functionality, SessionConfiguration data structure for containing all of the settings, CellularAutomatonSession which uses this data structure to set up a new interactive simulation with appropriate calls to Grid and Control constructors, and SessionConfigurationManager to make appropriate method calls to these and handle input. The SessionConfigurationMannager will be able to start a session from an existing configuration, create a new configuration, or run the default configuration. 

### August 14, 2020

**Today's Progress:** PCA upgrades.

**Notes:** I'm working on this simulaiton configuration manager upgrade. I think the project really needs this basic usability improvemnt before I feel OK about publishing it. So far I have two new models, one to manage loading and creating configurations for initial sim starting conditions, and another for handling and storing configuration settings. I'm still trying to figure out how everything will work for this part.

I think I will probably have to implement similar but completely seperate models for the replay functionality I'm imagining.

### August 13, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Prepare PCA to add to PyPI.

**Notes:** I'm preparing to publish the PCA project to the Python Package Index. I haven't done this with any other projects yet. There's a lot for me to learn about here, but for now at least the setup file is ready to go.

I'm considering making another upgrade beforehand though. This one would let me get rid of all of these example scripts and just use one main script that loads a custom configuration from a file. This would also be able to help the user to easily create new configuation files to load. 

Figuring that out will also be a good starting point for creating some system that can replay a previous simulation where the user was interactive, something that can reproduce a specific output. I think this will be possible with very little data storage; it should only need the initial starting state and Grid settings, and the number of steps between whatever ruleset changes occur. 

### August 12, 2020

**Today's Progress:** PCA upgrades.

**Notes:** I've finished implementing a simple class to help manage individual system configuration settings. For the first simulation on each new system, this manager will prompt the user to define system-specific settings. These settings will then be written to a file so they can presist through subsequent runs. 

### August 11, 2020

**Today's Progress:** PCA upgrades.

**Notes:** I have a Django project started, so now I need to package PCA on pypi so that I can work with it. Before doing that, I need to do some simple upgrades that will make it basically acceptable to run on other machines.

### August 10, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Planning Django interface for PCA. Other PCA upgrades.

**Notes:** I'm going to pause the volunteer registration project for now, until I can figure out how to proceed with the dynamic forms and some other Django concepts that feel a little too advanced for me just yet. 

Now I am working on planning the next Django project, which I want to be an interface for my PCA project. I realize that this won't really be able to be run anywehre except on specific systems with CUDA cards; at least it is a start to gettting an interface together, and will help me keep practicing with Django. 

### August 7, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued Django volunteer registration project. Worked on PCA use-case, planning upgrades. 

**Notes:** It may be fairly involved to be able to get dynamic forms like I want for this volunteer registration app. I'm still trying to figure out the best way to go about it. 

I'm using PCA to try to make many different images for a side project. The way I have to use it is still very cluncky and difficult, so using it for this real application is helping me find and plan the next phase of usability upgrades.

### August 6, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued Django volunteer registraion project.

**Notes:** I'm trying to figure out the best way to generate and render dynamic forms in order to reliably set a particular application template's quesions as fields on a form that can be filled out and submitted by the volunteer users.

### August 5, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued Django volunteer registraiton project.

**Notes:** I guess I'll hold off on the design part for now until I get the back-end mostly situated. I now have minimal but working forms on the new ApplicatoinTemplate creation page. The first form is ApplicationTemplateForm which is a forms.ModelForm for directly creating new ApplicationTemplate instances, and the second is for adding questions that are related to that particular ApplicationTemplate instance with a foreign key. When the forms are submitted, a new ApplicationTemplate object is created and it is then used as the related field as the view creates each new Question instance from however many fields were compleded on the  AddQuestionsform forms.Form.

### August 4, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued Django volunteer registration project. 

**Notes:** I'm working on the front-end forms and presentation so users will be able to create or fill out new volunteer applications. Organization users will be able to post job description and blank custom applications for the volunteer users to fill out and submit back to the organizaton to review. The data is mostly connected and functioning for the first page which is for creating new custom volunteer application templates, but only as basic text. Now I need to work on improving the design, and then repeating this process for creating the other page for the volunteer application submission interface.

### August 3, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued Django volunteer registration project.

### July 31, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued Django volunteer registration project. 

**Notes:** Working on the forms for the application submission paage and new application template creation page. 

### July 30, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued Django volunteer registration project. 

**Notes:** I've finished the front page/index page for this volunteer app. Now I need to work on the design and templates for the registration detail/form page and application creation form page. 

### July 29, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued Django volunteer registration project. 

### July 28, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued Django volunteer registration project. 

### July 27, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued Django volunteer registration project. Made a script to help with convering a page from the Bootstrap Studio exports into a Django template. 

### July 24, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Worked on design for volunteer registration app Django project. 

**Notes:** Used Bootstrap Studio to create the main layout and export the html, styles, and assets to be integrated into the existing Django project. At this point the back-end supports retrieving data for several list views that will all use some version of this base layout. 

### July 2, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Completed ICV lesson 37. 

**Notes:** I'm excited to see more of this computer vision unit on motion. This lesson covered an overview of this new unit about estimating motion from video. 

### July 1, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued CodingNomads Django course.

### June 30, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished ICV lesson 36. Started JetBrains Academy Django course/project. Researching next courses. 

**Notes:** This was the last ICV lesson in this unit that is going over the relationships between different aspects of lightness of an object in an image and its physical shape. Most of this unit was understandable theory, with only a tiny bit of abstract math that I had to grit my teeth through. It is OK to just comprehend it well enough to vaguely agree with, because it turns out that the implementation of purely mathmatical methods don't do very well in practice. I guess it just helps to know what others have tried.

I'm starting an additional new Django course to help me get to a more comfortable place with that world. [This course](https://hyperskill.org/projects/102?track=2) is free for five months at JetBrains Academy, and covers the path all the way back to if I were starting from knowing nothing about programming. Because this course covers every single topic leading up to what I'm doing in Django, it is a good resource to use to quickly determine which of my conceptual holes is giving me the most trouble now that I'm trying to do a real app with Django. 

### June 29, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Started ICV lesson 36. Started Django course at [CodingNomads](https://codingnomads.co/courses/django-course-learn-django-online). 

### June 18, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Completed ICV lesson 35. Revising active courses.

**Notes:** This ICV lesson lightness. These are still all theory, but I'm enjoying these lessons a lot more than I have the last few units.

I'm looking for a course to help improve my inderstanding of how to organize large programs and design software. PCA is going to get (more) out of hand soon if I don't improve my software design skills. The Rice Fundamentals of Computing specialization courses that I was taking last year gave me a good foundation in object oriented design, but I certainly need more instruction in order to be able to create larger systems that aren't hopelessly convoluted.

### June 17, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Completed ICV lesson 34. Continued planning PCA storage system.

**Notes:** This ICV lesson is starting a new unit on reflection.

I'm still trying to figure out the best storage system for serialized data. I'm not sure if I will using a lightning memory-mapped database (LMDB) or a hierarchical data format (HDF5) file. I'm playing around with the LMDB first, but will try the other as well before attempting to integrate anything into PCA.

### June 16, 2020

**Today's Progress:** More planning for PCA data storage system. 

### June 15, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Working on PCA storage system.

**Notes:** PCA can record everything that happens on each step, but it is painfully slow. This is because it currently uses OpenCV or Pygame methods to save state shot, screen shot, or equalized image arrays to disk as .png's. The slowness wasn't an issue when each step took 1 to 20 seconds to calculate with the original processing mode, but I don't try to use those slow methods to save each step now that the sim can calculate 30 steps or more per second. Now if I want to capture each step of the progress for a sim, I just capture my screen with an external tool. This is fine for playback, but reconstructing the step data from this video would be silly. I'd like to be able to easily explore the steps as raw data after they are captured, so I'm trying to figure out how to overhaul the capture/storage system to be able to perform at the same speed as the sim calculations.

### June 12, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Figuring out how to improve website data models. Finished ICV lesson 33.

**Notes:** I'm starting to add some projects to the site database, and I'm realizing that the Project data model needs a lot of help. I want to be able to add any number of text sections and pictures to each project, so I'm trying to figure out how to do that with the Django ORM. My first thought to allow for an arbitrary number of text sections is to add a Blurb data model and have each instance refer to a particular Project instance with a foreign key project attribute.

I think this was the last lesson for this ICV unit on feature matching.

### June 11, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Setting up website update system. Minor website content updates. Continued ICV lesson 33.

**Notes:** I spent a lot of time today trying to figure out how I broke the site. At some point after switching everything over to using the new directory on the server that pulls from the live-site repo, everything broke. It started with the static images not appearing, and quickly devolved as I tried to figure out what was happening. It turns out that I had made several mistakes yesterday when I was attempting to reproduce the directory, install the virtual environment, and reconfigure Apache. It was really hard to debug because of these coinciding oversights, and I was very lost. Luckily, I found a way to make it partially work from the old directory again and found my multiple illusive mistakes in the new one. I'm relieved it is working again.

I thought I could solve my local testing situation by having a seperate branch for development. My thought was that I could somehow partially merge this with master when I was done adding and testing a feature, to prevent two files from changing on the server because I need to keep a seperate version here to be able to test the project locally. That idea doesn't really make sense, and the way to make it work with gitattributes seems like it would just be introducing many more things that I'd have to worry about. I'm not sure how to make it work seamlessly. For now I will just change the files here, add the feature and test everything, then really hope I remember to ignore the changes just on those two files before commiting. I could also add them to the .gitignore, but I'd have to remove them and re-add them any time they needed updating. 

### June 10, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Planning and setting up website update system. 

**Notes:** Git is definately the better choice for keeping things synced. The website is now working from a new git repo and the master branch will always be synced with whatever's running on the live version of the site. I'm having a hard time figuring out what will be the easiest way to test changes to the site locally, as two files need to be different for running from here. 

### June 9, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Started ICV lesson 33. Worked on website update scripts. 

**Notes:** This ICV lesson is covering a lot of the algorithmic implementation details for the theory-heavy process that was covered in the last lesson. Apparently this method is called RANSAC. I guess I just needed to wait a day.

I've started working on the automated update program for my Django portfolio site. The live site has a few slightly different files from the site that is publicly published on GitHub under [this repo](https://github.com/grant-king/demo-site/tree/master/working_project), so i've just been using scp in bash to update individual files and directories as needed so far. In trying to figure out how to automate this, I think I've spent a lot of time today focusing on the wrong way to do it. I should have been tipped off by the development activity of the libraries I've been digging into, but it took hours of working around workarounds to see that this hasn't been the way to do it for at least 5 years. I just need to use git, duh. I'll make a private repo that I keep updated to sync with the server and figure out how to incompletely update the repo with the public version from that.

### June 8, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued PCA upgrades. Restarted and completed Georgia Tech Intro to Computer Vision (ICV) lesson 32 on Udacity.

**Notes:** Controlling the PCA program while a sim is running is getting easier. Input is better validated through the controls handlers. 

I've added a feature for setting a timer that will cycle through a list of rulesets at some indicated regular interval. This allows for near-unlimited new hybrid rulesets. The timer mechanism responsible for this switching rulesets prevents me from setting more than one list of regularly-alternating rulesets, as it just calls a generic timer and shifts members of the cycle list. It might be nice to be able to have different intervals for each ruleset or more than one ruleset list cycling thorough rulesets on the same sim. Alternatively, maybe the same effect could be achieved by implementing a new hybrid rule class that has some rulesets list and switching interval coomponents. Whatever the evolution of the implementation ends up being, it is nice to see the impressive results in any way for now.

It is unfortunate that I've had to start this ICV lesson several times over the last month, but I was finally able to get through it today. It makes sense, but I'm still not a fan of the explanations of the underlying math. It seems like it is frequently presented in a way that makes it hard to relate to the current task. This stuff is a lot easier to understand if I use this instructors descriptions to gather relevant terms to search, then go look up the math explanation and CV relevance elsewhere. I wish this course had more focus on the implementation of these theories, instead of this ocean of equations that just validate the results. Luckily I can choose where my focus goes, so I just have to not get caught up in trying to comprehend that end of things that I feel this course disproportionately presents.

### June 5, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued PCA upgrades. 

**Notes:** Update color aging routine. See [this commit](https://github.com/grant-king/python-cellular-automata/commit/d82f92fcd1c3de7119cfe63e118a22c4371f8cbe) for details.

### June 4, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued PCA upgrades. Website stuff.

### June 3, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Completed Django tutorial 16. Website errors.

**Notes:** I decided to go ahead with using S3 from AWS for media storage. I wasn't convinced that I needed to, but I may as well implement this while everything is new and my projects are unpopulated. The switch was a success. There was some more configuration hurdles and moats of error to push through, but all of the file stuff is working now. Now I won't ever have to worry about the size or quantity of project media files.

I found another non-urgent error that I will have to keep working on; having to do with the SSL certificate when attempting to access the site form a non-www version of the domain. I don't fully understand the recent rule changes that have left this broken, but the several fixes I've tried haven't resolved the issue. It probably isn't worth spending much more time on for now, surely I will stumble across the answer at some point.

### June 2, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued PCA upgrades. Completed Django tutorial 15. Fixed all remaining website issues.

**Notes:** Continuing with small PCA upgrades. Today I added input validation to ruleset change handler, which will handle bad input and print instructions with ruleset names if nonexistant ruleset name is entered at the prompt. I also updated the FPS condrol scheme so that it is less tedious to operate and no longer has an error-borne FPS cap.

After running around in circles for a while, I finally figured out why media files weren't appearing on my portfolio site. I was editing the apache configuraiton with nano, and had made an error in one of the file alias rules set there. In trying to find the fix, I also went through the process to get the custom domain working with SSL. Finally, there were a few more external things to do to get SMTP working. With all of these in place, the site infrastructure is now fully functional. It is up, but I won't link to it from my various profile pages until I can add enough projects.

I imagine I might also see a few things to improve while I'm adding these initial projects... I should get some automated pipeline in place to make visual design changes or infrastructure changes automatically update on the server. The first part of this will be the reference-replacing script I've already mentioned for cutting and converting Bootstrap Studio exports into the appropriate Django templates. The other part will be soemthing that can replace certain files in the public site repo and then update everything in the server's project directory without breaking the site.

### June 1, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Worked on PCA upgrades.

**Notes:** I'm really happy to finally get back to work on my python-cellular-automata repo today. Even after just a month, it took a little time to reacquaint myself with the code again. This time, I'm seeing more obvious places where I can simplify the program flow and untangle the original and imporved processing modes. There were more important things to get to first, though. Today I added some aspect-preserving image resizing functionality to the image-loading routine. Now the main window and grid resize on loading a new image to match the aspect ratio of that image without exceeding the maximum dimensions of the SCREEN_SIZE constant that is set at the beginning of each simulation configuration example. 

### May 29, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished Django tutorial 13, completed tutorial 14.

**Notes:** I had the site up and almost fully working from the server's public IP address, but I couldnt' get the mail functionality to work. It turns out that the provider I'm using, Linode, blocks the port used for SMTP until some DNS requiremnts are met. I moved on to the 14th tutorial on custom domains which will happen to meet these requirments, but the DNS settings aren't allowing me to access the site from a custom domain yet. I think I also broke somehting; the project images are not loading anymore. I think I will stop the server until next week when I can figure out what is going on.

### May 28, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished Django tutorial 12. Started tutorial 13. 

**Notes:** Everything is ready for the site to go up. After watching the video once all the way though without following, I'm now followig Corey's process for setting up a Linux server from scratch. I'm glad that I'm not having to do any significant custimizatino in this part, it is certainly the part I'm least comfortable with. Now that I'm going through the motions, I'm remembering more of this sys admin stuff from school. I'm not sure that I'd be able to do this on my own this first time without such clear instruction, but I think I could be comfortable with trying on my own at some point because most of these steps make sense from within my very limited knowledge of system administration.

### May 27, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued Django project. Started Django Tutorial 12. 

**Notes:** I'm tyring to figure out some better ways to set element styles, I didn't realize the way I've been doing it sets inline styles using the style keyword attribute within each html tag, instead of setting global styles. It is messy and repetitive. I want easy consistency, so inline styling isn't the way to do it. I think using global styles will also make it easier to translate the html from the file rendered by Bootsrap Studio into the template-style of Django's html. 

The easiest thing to do would be for me to write a script that automatically replaces the relative links or assets from the Bootstrap Studio rendered file with code and context blocks as it is copied to the Django template file. Making this helpful tool should be a higher priority.

I am getting through this next tutorial on publishing using a Linux server. I haven't started doing it myself, I'm mostly just watching so far. I'm glad to see how Corey is setting up an Ubuntu server; most of it is vaguely familiar, but some stuff is completely new information to me. It seems like this part is going to take a lot of energy.

### May 26, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued Django Project. Finished Django tutorial 12. 

**Notes:** The email functionality is now working for when someone fills out the form to collaborate or request volunteer work. Several styling issues are now resolved across the site, as well. 

### May 22, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued Django Project. Finished Django tutorial 11, started 12. 

**Notes:**  Finished following tutorial 11, but for mine I added a categorical tag query feature for the project page. The site is almost to the point where it could be published. I think it will be ready in one more day. I still want to finish following this last tutorial and set up my email confirmation system before moving to figuring out how I will publish it. 

I imagine I can quickly tidy up all of the loose ends so that I have most of next week to figure out how to publish. There are four more videos after this one having somehting to do with publishing on a Linux server and a final video on just using Heroku. I really don't know what to expect for how difficult it will be to figure out, I haven't ever tried to do this part. I hope it is something I can just mimic to make it work; surely it won't require much customization.

I hope there is also time to finish ICV lesson 32 and do some stuff for PCA next week. I am itching to get back to my other projects.

### May 21, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued Django project. Started tutorial 11. 

### May 20, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued Django project. Completed Django tutorial 10. 

**Notes:** I've made some more design adjustments and am fleshing out the cards that will be on the projects list page. Each card will display a summary for a different Project object, displaying image, title, subtitle, and summary attributes. At the end of each card there are buttons that link to the project detail page and a demonstration of the app. Demo buttons will only appear if the Project object has a valid existing app_link attribute.

### May 19, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued Django project. Finished Django tutorial 9. Continued ICV lesson 32.

**Notes:** I"m getting closer to a complete site. I spent some time writing this fancy aspect-preserving image resizing function for my project pictures, only to realize that this newer version of Django must automatically resize uploads. It is OK though, I needed the practice so that I can do a something similar for my Python-Cellular-Automata project. I can also just move this function in the simple thresholding app I'm planning.

### May 18, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued Django project. Finished following Corey Schafer's YouTube Django tutorial 8 again, started 9. Restarted ICV lesson 32.

**Notes:** This Django project is moving forward smoothly, although once in a while I'll hit a hiccup that takes a little time to iron out. I'm glad that I am getting more familiar with Django and that the error pages and console errors seem less cryptic. 

I needed to restart this ICV lesson that I haven't worked on in a few weeks. It covers some ways of calculating the error for two images with corresponding features. 

### May 15, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued working on portfolio site Django project. Finished tutorial 7, started 8.

**Notes:** The site is close to the most basic version of what I want to publish soon. I have a few more design things to add like a footer to the base template and some positioning elements on the project list view page. I will probably switch to using class-based views for projects page and the project detail page. I also still have to design and configure a project detail page. I feel like I am still on track to publish something minimal by the end of next week.

### May 14, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued working on portfolio site Django project. Finished tutorial 6. 

**Notes:** Django project structure and workflow is making more sense. At this point I'm trying to do what I can on my own, then watch enough video to confirm I didn't miss anything important and move on to the next chunk of work.

I have some placeholder forms and models for the volunteer request page and the collaborator connection page. I am making a point to keep everything in both aspects of the site design as simple as possible, just enough to make sure things will work the way I want them to.

### May 13, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued working on portfolio site Django project and design. Continued Django tutorial 6.

**Notes:** I now have the contact page working with links to volunteer request and collaborator contact pages where I'll put forms. 

### May 12, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued new site design. Finished Django tutorial 3, completed 4 and 5, and started 6.

**Notes:** I have added a couple of functioning pages now. I have the main page with a bit about me and Bootstrap card elements to my projects and contact pages. The projects page is a list page containing a BS card for each project. I haven't designed or implemented the contact page yet. I plan to also add a project detial page soon.

### May 11, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Started designing new site in Bootstrap Studio. Restarted Django tutorials, finished parts 1 and 2, and started part 3.

**Notes:** I'm feeling a lot more comfortable with using Bootstrap, and am getting better with Bootstrap Studio. It is really nice to be able to immediately see the visual difference between various options and appearance settings for each component. This is a much faster way to get familiar with Bootstrap classes. I'm getting better at understanding some of the basics of Bootstrap class usage as it is employed within the html, but I haven't explored how to mess with the CSS yet. I shouldn't need to for this version of the design though, I'm just trying to get a minimal layout while I tinker with functionality.

### May 8, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued 12th Django tutorial.

**Notes:** I think I'm to a good restarting point with these Django tutorials. There is still a little left in this 12th tutorial, but I'm snagged on an external email configuration task that doesn't actually matter for my purposes. The next tutorial is on deployment, so I think here is a good place to stop for now. Next week I will come up with a design for the initial site I want to use, and then I can zip back through all of the steps up to this point to get that site ready to publish.

### May 7, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Started 12th Django tutorial. 

### May 6, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Completed 11th Django tutorial.

### May 5, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished 10th Django tutorial. Completed first Bootstrap Studio project and integrated it into demo site.

**Notes:** Bootstrap Studio is going to make the design of the site a lot more managable. I'm not sure how I thought I'd be able to handle it without somehting like this. I'm lucky to find it before wasting time trying to alter the look by directly editing the html and css. Today I familiarized myself with the software and made a first project. Each of the asset files, generated on export by Studio, still have to be manually edited and moved into the appropriate locations within the Django project structure. The bulk of these manual edits were changing the file references that are in the generated html to variable references recognized by Django's templating engine. If I have to do this for each page with each design overhaul, it will certainly be worth it to write a script to change all of the generated relative file references to the Django-friendly references. 

### May 4, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued 10th Django tutorial. Investigating Bootstrap Studio.

**Notes:** This Django tutorial is introducing class-based views, and so far has shown how to use and add to the generic views that can be imported from django.views. 

I've found something that may greatly reduce the effort I have to put into the visual design of the site. Bootstrap Studio seems to be exactly what I've needed.

### April 27, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Started ICV lesson 32.

### April 24, 2020

**Today's Progress:** ICV lesson 31. Started 10th Django tutroial. 

### April 23, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished Django tutorial 9. ICV lesson 30.

**Notes:** The Django stuff is getting to be more enjoyable as I get more reacquainted with this project that I worked on in 2018. Today's tutorial went over adding more user account control elements that I hadn't gotten to last time through. I can see why I might have skipped this section of the tutorial then, but now I'm gald to get some practice with forms and model attribute access.

This ICV unit continues with describing various techniques to reliably find and match features between images.

### April 22, 2020

**Today's Progress:** ICV lesson 29. Django tutorial 8, started tutorial 9.

### April 21, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished ICV lesson 28. Finished 7th Django tutorial. 

**Notes:** I think I must have just been anticipating an endless parade of nearly-incomprehensible math again. The math wrapped up quickly enough and the rest of ICV lesson 28 was more of the stuff I've been expecting in this course. Luckily OpenCV encapsulates all of these difficult Harris corner and other feature-detecting algorithms into a few simple functions. I'm glad to have someone open it up and show me the math behhind this amazing process, and now I will probably never have to really worry about it again.

The Django project is getting easier. I'm starting to run into tutorial material that I don't have my version of code for; I don't know if I skipped stuff or didn't get to it with this project. I remember learning stuff form some of the later tutorial videos while doing a Django project, although it may not have been with this one. I don't need all of these elements, but this time I'll duplicate everything while I'm following along and learning with this demo version of the site.

### April 20, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Started ICV lesson 28. Finished 6th, started 7th Django tutorial.

**Notes:** I had hoped this ICV unit would be less rife with dense math, but no. More math and still no coding exercises in sight.

The Django tutorials are going well, but I keep getting frustrated with some extra things I added. It is unpleasant trying to figure out enough about what I did to get the styles the way they are. Some things aren't displaying how I'd like, and I'm mostly relying on trial and error to make things passable. I want to remember this kind of frustration when I'm designing the next project. I need to keep the design simple enough that it stays within the limitations of my minor experience with HTML/CSS/JS. It seems like part of my mistake was designing as I went while trying to incorporate not-well-understood elements from multiple third-party Bootstrap kits, without having a firm foundation in regular Bootstrap use. I've forgotten a lot of the Bootstrap fundamentals so now I am having to deal with a design that is more difficult than it is worth.

### April 17, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Started 6th Django tutorial.

### April 16, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Django tutorial 5.

**Notes:** I have the first couple pages of the blog app about to where they were visually, although they aren't as fully functional as they were a year and a half ago. There are just two pages in this 'blog' app of the project, and another couple of pages for the 'users' app that I haven't gotten to yet. I think the rest of my code should be easy to figure out after another six or so of these videos. The Bootstrap and custom 3rd party themes that I had added originally were making things a little confusing as I was trying to re-follow the tutorials. I'm slowly remembering some of this extra stuff that I added, too. I want to keep future design additions as simple as possible though, so I can focus on functionality first and then figure out aesthetics later. For the remainder of these tutorials I think I will just minimally retrace my steps. When I'm back up to speed with Django I'll be able to plan a new project and easily repeat the general steps to create the goal portfolio site. 

### April 15, 2020

**Today's Progress:** ICV lesson 27. Finished 3rd and 4th Django tutorials. 

**Notes:** After going through these next Django tutorials, I have been able to get a couple of pages running as they were in my previous portfolio-site project from 2018. It is nice to see what I worked on before. I can now remember fiddling around with these custom Bootstrap design elements. The Home page now looks like it was before, but not much works yet. 

### April 14, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished ICV lesson 26. Started following 3rd Django tutorial. 

**Notes:**I'm so glad to be done with this unit on stereo vision in Intro to Computer Vision. It has been mind-numbingly mathy and technical, but the brisk pace and lack of exercises has made it clear that they aren't trying to present something that would aid in anything close to complete comprehension. This is just a flyby, and I'm glad to get an overview of the kind of math that I wouldn't enjoy delving into. 

 I'm continuing to try and decipher my old Django project as I'm going through these tutorials again. This 3rd tutorial on Templates is helping me through most of what was difficult to understand yesterday. I've cloned the old project that I had on Github to my desktop so that I could try and see how it functions and what it looks like. Unfortunately the project doesn't work when I try to run it here; the errors are vague and I think misleading. I had version 2 or less before, but now Django is up to 3.0.5. I think the easiest way to get it running again is to follow the tutorials and slowly fold functioning code into this new project until it is all there as it was in the old one. 

### April 13, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Started ICV lesson 26. Started (again) Corey Schafer Django tutorial series on YouTube. Finished 1st and 2nd videos out of 17.  

**Notes:** I'm going to start devoting some time every week to building a portfolio/professional website with Django. I started making one about a year and a half ago, but I don't remember much about how I built it. While I'm refamilirizing myself with my old code, I'm going back through the [Django tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTtoQCKZ03TU5fNfx2UY6U4p) by Corey Schafer on Youtube.

### April 10, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished ICV lesson 25. 

**Notes:** There is one more lesson in this ICV unit on stereo relations. I'm really not enjoying the math through this unit, but the summaries and gist of what the math means still make sense. I'm excited to move on from this stuff that is very heavy on linear algebra. 

### April 9, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished ICV lesson 24. Started Lesson 25. Finished chapter 3 of Image Processing in Python. Continued GUI image tool project. 

### April 8, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Started ICV lesson 24. Reviewing related linear algebra on Khan Academy.

### April 7, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued lesson 3 of Image Processing in Python at DataCamp. Continued image tool project.

### April 6, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued Intro to Computer Vision, completed lesson 23. Started Chapter 3 of Image Processing in Pytohn at DataCamp. 

**Notes:** I really liked this ICV lesson's lectures. It introduces mosaic images and image rectification. I'm excited to try to reproduce some of the rectification stuff. I haven't seen them use any Matlab for a while, so i'm thinking this large chunk of course is just meant to give context and theory for things that they will be demonstrating soon.

### April 3, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished Image Processing in Python, chapter 2 at DataCamp.

**Notes:** This chapter reviewed skimage tools for some different types of histogram equalization, resizing, and some morphological operations for binary images. I've already done a lot of the resizing stuff in OpenCV, but it is nice to learn the equivalent skimage tools. I'm especially glad to be exposed to these histogram equalization methods in this chapter.

### April 2, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued PyQt5 image tool project. 

**Notes:** I've made more progress with the tool. This fixed-sized GUI window can now browse all images in a directory, displaying each with the options to preview or save a black and white version. New seek and previous buttons allow for file navigation. Each next picture scales to display with the same aspect ratio within the fixed main GUI windodw.

### April 1, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued PyQt5 tutorials and image tool project.

### March 30, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued PyQt5 tutorials.

**Notes:** I'm making a very simple photo thresholding tool to have something simple to repeat these GUI exercizes on. The most basic version of this will select, read color input image, display the black and white version, and optionally save it to file. 

### March 30, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued PyQt5 tutorials. 

**Notes:**  I've gotten through most of the Tech With Tim PyQt5 tutorials. I'm now able to use Qt creator to quickly set up an interface with draggable widgets. This ui file can be easily converted to .py by the pyuic5 CLI utility. Once in that form, it is easy to modify and set callbacks for the various ui elements. 

I've been using PCA to try and apply some of this as I learn. There is some trouble trying to get the ui windows to run in tandem with the Pygame window. The Qt ui will start and never seems to give Pygame the opportunity to update the display window or the other procedures it does per cycle, like watch for keydown events. I have vague theories about why this is happening, but it's probably not worth it to figure that out while I'm tyring to learn Qt. Maybe a better approach is to try applying Qt lessons to a simpler project for now.

Once I have a handle on Qt basics, I will be in a better position to either decide to make the transition from Pygame to Qt in one fell swoop, or to try and figure out if I can make them run at the same time.

### March 27, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Started PyQt5 tutorial. Started PCA GUI updates.

**Notes:** I'm following a great [PyQt5 tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzMcBGfZo4-lB8MZfHPLTEHO9zJDDLpYj) from "Tech With Tim" on YouTube. Qt makes much more sense this time around. I think I couldn't find accessible docs or tutorials last time I tired to get started with it. I'm going to see what I can do to move PCA from using Pygame to Qt.

### March 26, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Started Chapter 2 of Image Processing at DataCamp. Worked on PCA updates. 

**Notes:** This image processing corse has already revealed a useful tool that I can immediately apply to PCA. There is some trouble when saving images from all current cell colors. If the rule set is chaotic it can produce an image that is washed out or really dark after several hundred steps. The save_image method of Capture is now using the adaptive histogram equalization from skimage exposure tools to produce highly visible output images.

### March 25, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished Image Processing in Python, Chapter 1. Finished ICV lesson 22.

**Notes:**
This first chapter of the image processing course is really simple; it introduces some basic image operations using skimage and numpy. It covered things like color conversion, channel selection, producing histograms, and b&w thresholding. I'm glad to be getting practice at this simple stuff that I skipped when starting the ICV course. I'm sure I'll find some techniques that I can use to enhance the output from PCA simulations.

Even though this first chapter is all very simple, I'm realizing why I used to get so frustrated trying to learn on this site. If you don't just type exactly what they want in the spaces they want it, the exercise won't accept your answer. With so many different ways to do things in Python, it seems like it would be better to just test output. Like how testing usually works. Instead DataCamp seems to rely on a grading system that can apparently only judge the text in a script.

This ICV lsson covered image to image transformations and projective transforms. It makes sense at a surface level, but I'm not going to try to recreate any of it for now. If I come back and do a more thurough delve into this portion of the course, this would be a good lesson to spend more time on.

### March 24, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued PCA reorganization.

**Notes:** I'm having a hard time figuring out how to separate, where to put code for the two alternative processing modes. The system could be easily curtailed to contain only the functional models, but I don't want to lose the ability to compare the incredible speed difference from within the same version of the project. 

There are still a couple of methods from the new processing modes that rely on some of the old Cell object update methods in order to get each sim running. Once I untangle that I think I can isolate all of the old Cell stuff to a new object-oriented models file. I hope this can mirror the new processing modes models that are now contained in functional_models.py.

### March 23, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Started Intro to Computer Vision Lesson 22 on Udacity. Started Image Processing in Python at DataCamp. 

**Notes:** The ICV course has been so dense for the last several lessons. It is hard to figure out how I could apply the theory they are trudging through, but I know there are gems here and there. It will be worth it as long as I don't break my brain trying to comprehend the hard math.

I'm starting a course at datacamp, [Image Processing in Python](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/image-processing-in-python). It looks like it can offer some useful imaging techniques while I wait for the other course to level out. It has four chapters.

### March 20, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued PCA updates.

### March 19, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued PCA updates.

**Notes:** Today working on more performance monitor updates, adding new grid options for setting processing mode, as well as color and visualization options. I'm adding a couple of new examples to explore these new optons.

### March 18, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued PCA updates. Continued IPC lesson 3.

**Notes:** I'm having a hard time with logging working the way I want it to work. It is easiest to ditch the logging module and set up my own simple logging with a method in the performance monitoring models. I've also been able to streamline and upgrade those models today.

### March 17, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued IPC lesson 3. Finished last two sections of the functional programming tutorial at Real Python. Begin PCA updates.

**Notes:** It seems like there will be a lot of residual optimizing and tidying from the refactor, but for the most part I can start working on other updates.

Today I'm adding a way to switch between processing modes, and looking at improvments to the performance monitoring models. I need a better way to store performance metrics in order to be able to review how code changes are affecting things. Logging seems like too much of a headache to configure for what I want, and may be the source for some slowdown. 

### March 16, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished the first part of the CUDA implementation phase for PCA refactor.

**Notes:** I've been trying to get to this milestone for months, it seems. It has been purely frustrating for the last week, so I am extremely relived to be to this point now. Now CUDA is successfully, albeit shakily implemented. It runs so much faster than before. I don't have to record and replay them to observe large grids. I will have to make many more optimizations before I can realize the full speed potential.

The next steps will be much easier to do. I need to continue to optimize the CUDA portions, convert sporadic numpy operations to CUDA equivalents, implement multiprocessing on the CPU end to mitigate all of the CPU-bound bottlenecks, and do other obvious performance improvents. Now that these can be run in real-time, I can slowly chip away at those things as I find them, in-between adding the next features.

### March 13, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued IPC lesson 3. Continued NVIDIA course parts 2 and 3. Continued CUDA implementation for PCA.

### March 12, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued IPC lesson 3. Started CUDA implementation phase for PCA refactor. Started NVIDIA couse parts 2 and 3.

### March 11, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished IPC lesson 1. Started IPC lesson 3. 

**Notes:** Skipping lesson 2 interview for now.

### March 10, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued IPC lesson 1. Continued Nvidia course, part 1.

**Notes:** I'm working on the problem set for this first lesson. I'm stuck on a strange error that I can't figure out. It is difficult to debug what's going wrong with the CUDA portion. It is difficult to debug in Jupyter notebooks in general; I'm going to do the problem sets in a separate file for working on in VS Code.

### March 9, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued Intro to Parallel Computing, lesson 1. Continued Nvidia course, part 1.

**Notes:** I'm documenting IPC course progress in a notebook, like i'm doing for the ICV course. Also like in that course, I'm attempting to translate this course's non-Python stuff into Python stuff. 

This course uses CUDA C, so I'm following the Nvidia couse notebooks and other resources to help translate the course examples into CUDA Python equivalents.

### March 6, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued PCA refactor.

**Notes:** This first part of the refactor is done. Simulation is running like it was, but using new methods that operate on the grid as a whole, rather than on individual cells. 

These methods still operate on one cell at a time, so I didn't expect a lot of speedup. For larger grids this approach has sped things up slightly, though, something like 3-6x. I think most of this is because the new methods use and operate on large numpy arrays, rather than having to operate on many more, much smaller numpy arrays.

### March 5, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued PCA refactor.

### March 4, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued PCA refactor.

### March 3, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued PCA refactor.

### March 2, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued PCA refactor.

**Notes:** I don't want to change too much with the code, too quickly. I know that it will be easy to break things so that it is difficult to find where things are broken, and waste time. The code is fairly convoluted in some areas and is not easy to debug.

### February 28, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued PCA refactor.

**Notes:** There is a lot of work to do for this refactor. I'm not sure how things got to be this convoluted, but it needs a lot of rearranging before I will be able to test the new methods that calculate next steps from a snapshot of grid states.

### February 27, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued PCA refactor.

### February 26, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued NVIDIA course, part 1. Started refactor on Python Cellular Automata ca_models.py. 

**Notes:** I think I know enough about the basics to figure out how to rearrange the models in my Python-cellular-automata repository to be able to compute in parallel on the GPU. I think a slow, gradual refactor to an overall more functional approach will be easier than forking. 

### February 25, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished ICV lesson 21. Continued IPC lesson 1. Started NVIDIA course Fundamentals of Accelerated Computing with CUDA Python notebook 1 of 3.

**Notes:** This paid NVIDIA course should get me on the right track to knowing which CUDA Python implementation will be most useful for completing the challenges in the Udacity Introduction to Parallel Computing with CUDA C course. 

### February 24, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued IPC lesson 1. Continued Functional Programming in Python at Real Python. 

**Notes:** This Intro to Parallel Computing course is using C CUDA, but I want to use Python tools. I'm trying to find the right Python libraries to use.

### February 21, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued ICV lesson 21. Continued Introduction to Parallel Computing lesson 1.

### February 20, 2020

### February 5, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued ICV Lesson 14.

### February 4, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished ICV lesson 13. Started ICV Lesson 14.

**Notes:** The last few lessons have been very math-heavy explanations of how aliasing is an unfortunate effect of trying to capture continuous signals in a discrete space.

### February 3, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished ICV Lesson 12. Started ICV Lesson 13.

### January 24, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished ICV Lesson 11.

### January 23, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued ICV Lesson 11.

### January 22, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished ICV Lesson 10. Started Lesson 11.

### January 21, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished ICV Lesson 8. Finished Lesson 9.

### January 20, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Started Lesson 8 in Introduction to Computer Vision by Georgia Tech on Udacity.

**Notes:** Course Link:  https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud810

### January 17, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished ICV Lesson 6. Finished Lesson 7.

**Notes:** I am happy to see the math behind useful edge detection methods. It is neat to see the output from the Sorbel filters. I am just using built in Canny method without recreating the entire process for Lesson 7. 

### January 16, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued ICV Lesson 6. 

### January 15, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Started ICV Lesson 6 lectures.

**Notes:** This lesson focuses on finding lines by calculating image gradients. It reviews some basic concepts of multivariate calculus and shows how partial derivatives can be used to determine the locations of lines in an image. The calculus is very straightforward so far.

### January 14, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished ICV Lesson 4 activities. Finished Lesson 5 lectures.

**Notes:** I feel good about some newly developed techniques from the lesson 4 challenges. I am through with all of the lesson 5 lectures, but will probably rewatch when I do activities. I still need to complete the template filtering challenges, but am anxious to see other operations now. I will get back to the code as soon as lectures are a little less consumable.

### January 13, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued Lesson 4 for Introduction to Computer Vision from Georgia Tech on Udacity.

**Notes:** Recreating the course material in Python feels appropriately suited to my capabilities. The operations on images are still pretty straightforward and logically simple; the challenge is preparing input data and then implementing the operations in Python while limiting myself from using certain prebuilt tools. I feel like this is the best route to being the most appropriately experiened for the things I want to do after this course. 

I am looking forward to making time for projects this week, I think that some of what I have used for filtering challenges could be useful in the PCA project.

### January 10, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued ICV lesson 4.

### January 9, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued ICV. Finished Lesson 3, started lesson 4.

### January 8, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued ICV Lesson 3.

### January 7, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued Intro to Compuuter Vision Lesson 3.

### January 6, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued Intro to Computer Vision. Finished Lesson 2, Started Lesson 3.

**Notes:** As an added benefit, I am getting good practice with some very useful numpy methods while trying to translate this course's challenges into Python code.

### January 2, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued Intro to Computer Vision. Started Lesson 2.

**Notes:** This lesson covers some very basic operations on image arrays. Here is the file for notes: https://github.com/grant-king/report/blob/master/ICV_challenges/IntroCV_notes.ipynb.
The course uses Matlab but the equivalents are easy enough to convert to OpenCV with Python. I think these first lessons have to start slow; so far everything seems simple and familiar.

### January 1, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Started Georgia Tech Intro to Computer Vision: https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud810. Completed Lesson 1.

**Notes:** This Udiacity computer vision course is broken up into about 70 lessons.
