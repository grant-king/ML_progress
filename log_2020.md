# 2020 Log Record
This is a projects and learning progress log for this year. 

### January 22, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished ICV Lesson 10. Started Lesson 11.

### January 21, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished ICV Lesson 8. Finished Lesson 9.

### January 20, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Started Lesson 8 in Introduction to Computer Vision by Georgia Tech on Udacity.

**Notes** Course Link:  https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud810

### January 17, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished ICV Lesson 6. Finished Lesson 7.

**Notes** I am happy to see the math behind useful edge detection methods. It is neat to see the output from the Sorbel filters. I am just using built in Canny method without recreating the entire process for Lesson 7. 

### January 16, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued ICV Lesson 6. 

### January 15, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Started ICV Lesson 6 lectures.

**Notes** This lesson focuses on finding lines by calculating image gradients. It reviews some basic concepts of multivariate calculus and shows how partial derivatives can be used to determine the locations of lines in an image. The calculus is very straightforward so far.

### January 14, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished ICV Lesson 4 activities. Finished Lesson 5 lectures.

**Notes** I feel good about some newly developed techniques from the lesson 4 challenges. I am through with all of the lesson 5 lectures, but will probably rewatch when I do activities. I still need to complete the template filtering challenges, but am anxious to see other operations now. I will get back to the code as soon as lectures are a little less consumable.

### January 13, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued Lesson 4 for Introduction to Computer Vision from Georgia Tech on Udacity.

**Notes** Recreating the course material in Python feels appropriately suited to my capabilities. The operations on images are still pretty straightforward and logically simple; the challenge is preparing input data and then implementing the operations in Python while limiting myself from using certain prebuilt tools. I feel like this is the best route to being the most appropriately experiened for the things I want to do after this course. 

I am looking forward to making time for projects this week, I think that some of what I have used for filtering challenges could be useful in the PCA project.

### January 10, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued ICV lesson 4.

### January 9, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued ICV. Finished Lesson 3, started lesson 4.

### January 8, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued ICV Lesson 3.

### January 7, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued Intro to Compuuter Vision Lesson 3.

### January 6, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued Intro to Computer Vision. Finished Lesson 2, Started Lesson 3.

**Notes** As an added benefit, I am getting good practice with some very useful numpy methods while trying to translate this course's challenges into Python code.

### January 2, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued Intro to Computer Vision. Started Lesson 2.

**Notes:** This lesson covers some very basic operations on image arrays. Here is the file for notes: https://github.com/grant-king/report/blob/master/ICV_challenges/IntroCV_notes.ipynb.
The course uses Matlab but the equivalents are easy enough to convert to OpenCV with Python. I think these first lessons have to start slow; so far everything seems simple and familiar.

### January 1, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Started Georgia Tech Intro to Computer Vision: https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud810. Completed Lesson 1.

**Notes:** This Udiacity computer vision course is broken up into about 70 lessons.
