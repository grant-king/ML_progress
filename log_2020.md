# 2020 Log Record
This is a projects and learning progress log for this year. 

### January 13, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished Lesson 4 for Introduction to Computer Vision from Georgia Tech on Udacity.

**Notes** Recreating the course material in Python feels appropriately suited to my capabilities. The operations on images are still pretty straightforward and logically simple; the challenge is preparing input data and then implementing the operations in Python while limiting myself from using certain prebuilt tools. I feel like this is the best route to being the most appropriately experiened for the things I want to do after this course. 

I am looking forward to making time for projects this week, I think that some of what I have used for filtering challenges could be useful in the PCA project.

### January 10, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued ICV lesson 4.

### January 9, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued ICV. Finished Lesson 3, started lesson 4.

### January 8, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued ICV Lesson 3.

### January 7, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued Intro to Compuuter Vision Lesson 3.

### January 6, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued Intro to Computer Vision. Finished Lesson 2, Started Lesson 3.

**Notes** As an added benefit, I am getting good practice with some very useful numpy methods while trying to translate this course's challenges into Python code.

### January 2, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued Intro to Computer Vision. Started Lesson 2.

**Notes:** This lesson covers some very basic operations on image arrays. Here is the file for notes: https://github.com/grant-king/report/blob/master/ICV_challenges/IntroCV_notes.ipynb.
The course uses Matlab but the equivalents are easy enough to convert to OpenCV with Python. I think these first lessons have to start slow; so far everything seems simple and familiar.

### January 1, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Started Georgia Tech Intro to Computer Vision: https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud810. Completed Lesson 1.

**Notes:** This Udiacity computer vision course is broken up into about 70 lessons.
