# 2020 Log Record
This is a projects and learning progress log for this year. 

### May 19, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued Django project. Finished Django tutorial 9. Continued ICV lesson 32.

**Notes** I"m getting closer to a complete site. I spent some time writing this fancy aspect-preserving image resizing function for my project pictures, only to realize that this newer version of Django must automatically resize uploads. It is OK though, I needed the practice so that I can do a something similar for my Python-Cellular-Automata project. I can also just move this function in the simple thresholding app I'm planning.

### May 18, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued Django project. Finished following Corey Schafer's YouTube Django tutorial 8 again, started 9. Restarted ICV lesson 32.

**Notes** This Django project is moving forward smoothly, although once in a while I'll hit a hiccup that takes a little time to iron out. I'm glad that I am getting more familiar with Django and that the error pages and console errors seem less cryptic. 

I needed to restart this ICV lesson that I haven't worked on in a few weeks. It covers some ways of calculating the error for two images with corresponding features. 

### May 15, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued working on portfolio site Django project. Finished tutorial 7, started 8.

**Notes** The site is close to the most basic version of what I want to publish soon. I have a few more design things to add like a footer to the base template and some positioning elements on the project list view page. I will probably switch to using class-based views for projects page and the project detail page. I also still have to design and configure a project detail page. I feel like I am still on track to publish something minimal by the end of next week.

### May 14, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued working on portfolio site Django project. Finished tutorial 6. 

**Notes** Django project structure and workflow is making more sense. At this point I'm trying to do what I can on my own, then watch enough video to confirm I didn't miss anything important and move on to the next chunk of work.

I have some placeholder forms and models for the volunteer request page and the collaborator connection page. I am making a point to keep everything in both aspects of the site design as simple as possible, just enough to make sure things will work the way I want them to.

### May 13, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued working on portfolio site Django project and design. Continued Django tutorial 6.

**Notes** I now have the contact page working with links to volunteer request and collaborator contact pages where I'll put forms. 

### May 12, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued new site design. Finished Django tutorial 3, completed 4 and 5, and started 6.

**Notes** I have added a couple of functioning pages now. I have the main page with a bit about me and Bootstrap card elements to my projects and contact pages. The projects page is a list page containing a BS card for each project. I haven't designed or implemented the contact page yet. I plan to also add a project detial page soon.

### May 11, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Started designing new site in Bootstrap Studio. Restarted Django tutorials, finished parts 1 and 2, and started part 3.

**Notes** I'm feeling a lot more comfortable with using Bootstrap, and am getting better with Bootstrap Studio. It is really nice to be able to immediately see the visual difference between various options and appearance settings for each component. This is a much faster way to get familiar with Bootstrap classes. I'm getting better at understanding some of the basics of Bootstrap class usage as it is employed within the html, but I haven't explored how to mess with the CSS yet. I shouldn't need to for this version of the design though, I'm just trying to get a minimal layout while I tinker with functionality.

### May 8, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued 12th Django tutorial.

**Notes** I think I'm to a good restarting point with these Django tutorials. There is still a little left in this 12th tutorial, but I'm snagged on an external email configuration task that doesn't actually matter for my purposes. The next tutorial is on deployment, so I think here is a good place to stop for now. Next week I will come up with a design for the initial site I want to use, and then I can zip back through all of the steps up to this point to get that site ready to publish.

### May 7, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Started 12th Django tutorial. 

### May 6, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Completed 11th Django tutorial.

### May 5, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished 10th Django tutorial. Completed first Bootstrap Studio project and integrated it into demo site.

**Notes** Bootstrap Studio is going to make the design of the site a lot more managable. I'm not sure how I thought I'd be able to handle it without somehting like this. I'm lucky to find it before wasting time trying to alter the look by directly editing the html and css. Today I familiarized myself with the software and made a first project. Each of the asset files, generated on export by Studio, still have to be manually edited and moved into the appropriate locations within the Django project structure. The bulk of these manual edits were changing the file references that are in the generated html to variable references recognized by Django's templating engine. If I have to do this for each page with each design overhaul, it will certainly be worth it to write a script to change all of the generated relative file references to the Django-friendly references. 

### May 4, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued 10th Django tutorial. Investigating Bootstrap Studio.

**Notes** This Django tutorial is introducing class-based views, and so far has shown how to use and add to the generic views that can be imported from django.views. 

I've found something that may greatly reduce the effort I have to put into the visual design of the site. Bootstrap Studio seems to be exactly what I've needed.

### April 27, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Started ICV lesson 32.

### April 24, 2020

**Today's Progress:** ICV lesson 31. Started 10th Django tutroial. 

### April 23, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished Django tutorial 9. ICV lesson 30.

**Notes** The Django stuff is getting to be more enjoyable as I get more reacquainted with this project that I worked on in 2018. Today's tutorial went over adding more user account control elements that I hadn't gotten to last time through. I can see why I might have skipped this section of the tutorial then, but now I'm gald to get some practice with forms and model attribute access.

This ICV unit continues with describing various techniques to reliably find and match features between images.

### April 22, 2020

**Today's Progress:** ICV lesson 29. Django tutorial 8, started tutorial 9.

### April 21, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished ICV lesson 28. Finished 7th Django tutorial. 

**Notes** I think I must have just been anticipating an endless parade of nearly-incomprehensible math again. The math wrapped up quickly enough and the rest of ICV lesson 28 was more of the stuff I've been expecting in this course. Luckily OpenCV encapsulates all of these difficult Harris corner and other feature-detecting algorithms into a few simple functions. I'm glad to have someone open it up and show me the math behhind this amazing process, and now I will probably never have to really worry about it again.

The Django project is getting easier. I'm starting to run into tutorial material that I don't have my version of code for; I don't know if I skipped stuff or didn't get to it with this project. I remember learning stuff form some of the later tutorial videos while doing a Django project, although it may not have been with this one. I don't need all of these elements, but this time I'll duplicate everything while I'm following along and learning with this demo version of the site.

### April 20, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Started ICV lesson 28. Finished 6th, started 7th Django tutorial.

**Notes** I had hoped this ICV unit would be less rife with dense math, but no. More math and still no coding exercises in sight.

The Django tutorials are going well, but I keep getting frustrated with some extra things I added. It is unpleasant trying to figure out enough about what I did to get the styles the way they are. Some things aren't displaying how I'd like, and I'm mostly relying on trial and error to make things passable. I want to remember this kind of frustration when I'm designing the next project. I need to keep the design simple enough that it stays within the limitations of my minor experience with HTML/CSS/JS. It seems like part of my mistake was designing as I went while trying to incorporate not-well-understood elements from multiple third-party Bootstrap kits, without having a firm foundation in regular Bootstrap use. I've forgotten a lot of the Bootstrap fundamentals so now I am having to deal with a design that is more difficult than it is worth.

### April 17, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Started 6th Django tutorial.

### April 16, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Django tutorial 5.

**Notes** I have the first couple pages of the blog app about to where they were visually, although they aren't as fully functional as they were a year and a half ago. There are just two pages in this 'blog' app of the project, and another couple of pages for the 'users' app that I haven't gotten to yet. I think the rest of my code should be easy to figure out after another six or so of these videos. The Bootstrap and custom 3rd party themes that I had added originally were making things a little confusing as I was trying to re-follow the tutorials. I'm slowly remembering some of this extra stuff that I added, too. I want to keep future design additions as simple as possible though, so I can focus on functionality first and then figure out aesthetics later. For the remainder of these tutorials I think I will just minimally retrace my steps. When I'm back up to speed with Django I'll be able to plan a new project and easily repeat the general steps to create the goal portfolio site. 

### April 15, 2020

**Today's Progress:** ICV lesson 27. Finished 3rd and 4th Django tutorials. 

**Notes** After going through these next Django tutorials, I have been able to get a couple of pages running as they were in my previous portfolio-site project from 2018. It is nice to see what I worked on before. I can now remember fiddling around with these custom Bootstrap design elements. The Home page now looks like it was before, but not much works yet. 

### April 14, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished ICV lesson 26. Started following 3rd Django tutorial. 

**Notes**I'm so glad to be done with this unit on stereo vision in Intro to Computer Vision. It has been mind-numbingly mathy and technical, but the brisk pace and lack of exercises has made it clear that they aren't trying to present something that would aid in anything close to complete comprehension. This is just a flyby, and I'm glad to get an overview of the kind of math that I wouldn't enjoy delving into. 

 I'm continuing to try and decipher my old Django project as I'm going through these tutorials again. This 3rd tutorial on Templates is helping me through most of what was difficult to understand yesterday. I've cloned the old project that I had on Github to my desktop so that I could try and see how it functions and what it looks like. Unfortunately the project doesn't work when I try to run it here; the errors are vague and I think misleading. I had version 2 or less before, but now Django is up to 3.0.5. I think the easiest way to get it running again is to follow the tutorials and slowly fold functioning code into this new project until it is all there as it was in the old one. 

### April 13, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Started ICV lesson 26. Started (again) Corey Schafer Django tutorial series on YouTube. Finished 1st and 2nd videos out of 17.  

**Notes** I'm going to start devoting some time every week to building a portfolio/professional website with Django. I started making one about a year and a half ago, but I don't remember much about how I built it. While I'm refamilirizing myself with my old code, I'm going back through the [Django tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTtoQCKZ03TU5fNfx2UY6U4p) by Corey Schafer on Youtube.

### April 10, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished ICV lesson 25. 

**Notes** There is one more lesson in this ICV unit on stereo relations. I'm really not enjoying the math through this unit, but the summaries and gist of what the math means still make sense. I'm excited to move on from this stuff that is very heavy on linear algebra. 

### April 9, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished ICV lesson 24. Started Lesson 25. Finished chapter 3 of Image Processing in Python. Continued GUI image tool project. 

### April 8, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Started ICV lesson 24. Reviewing related linear algebra on Khan Academy.

### April 7, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued lesson 3 of Image Processing in Python at DataCamp. Continued image tool project.

### April 6, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued Intro to Computer Vision, completed lesson 23. Started Chapter 3 of Image Processing in Pytohn at DataCamp. 

**Notes** I really liked this ICV lesson's lectures. It introduces mosaic images and image rectification. I'm excited to try to reproduce some of the rectification stuff. I haven't seen them use any Matlab for a while, so i'm thinking this large chunk of course is just meant to give context and theory for things that they will be demonstrating soon.

### April 3, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished Image Processing in Python, chapter 2 at DataCamp.

**Notes** This chapter reviewed skimage tools for some different types of histogram equalization, resizing, and some morphological operations for binary images. I've already done a lot of the resizing stuff in OpenCV, but it is nice to learn the equivalent skimage tools. I'm especially glad to be exposed to these histogram equalization methods in this chapter.

### April 2, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued PyQt5 image tool project. 

**Notes** I've made more progress with the tool. This fixed-sized GUI window can now browse all images in a directory, displaying each with the options to preview or save a black and white version. New seek and previous buttons allow for file navigation. Each next picture scales to display with the same aspect ratio within the fixed main GUI windodw.

### April 1, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued PyQt5 tutorials and image tool project.

### March 30, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued PyQt5 tutorials.

**Notes** I'm making a very simple photo thresholding tool to have something simple to repeat these GUI exercizes on. The most basic version of this will select, read color input image, display the black and white version, and optionally save it to file. 

### March 30, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued PyQt5 tutorials. 

**Notes**  I've gotten through most of the Tech With Tim PyQt5 tutorials. I'm now able to use Qt creator to quickly set up an interface with draggable widgets. This ui file can be easily converted to .py by the pyuic5 CLI utility. Once in that form, it is easy to modify and set callbacks for the various ui elements. 

I've been using PCA to try and apply some of this as I learn. There is some trouble trying to get the ui windows to run in tandem with the Pygame window. The Qt ui will start and never seems to give Pygame the opportunity to update the display window or the other procedures it does per cycle, like watch for keydown events. I have vague theories about why this is happening, but it's probably not worth it to figure that out while I'm tyring to learn Qt. Maybe a better approach is to try applying Qt lessons to a simpler project for now.

Once I have a handle on Qt basics, I will be in a better position to either decide to make the transition from Pygame to Qt in one fell swoop, or to try and figure out if I can make them run at the same time.

### March 27, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Started PyQt5 tutorial. Started PCA GUI updates.

**Notes** I'm following a great [PyQt5 tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzMcBGfZo4-lB8MZfHPLTEHO9zJDDLpYj) from "Tech With Tim" on YouTube. Qt makes much more sense this time around. I think I couldn't find accessible docs or tutorials last time I tired to get started with it. I'm going to see what I can do to move PCA from using Pygame to Qt.

### March 26, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Started Chapter 2 of Image Processing at DataCamp. Worked on PCA updates. 

**Notes** This image processing corse has already revealed a useful tool that I can immediately apply to PCA. There is some trouble when saving images from all current cell colors. If the rule set is chaotic it can produce an image that is washed out or really dark after several hundred steps. The save_image method of Capture is now using the adaptive histogram equalization from skimage exposure tools to produce highly visible output images.

### March 25, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished Image Processing in Python, Chapter 1. Finished ICV lesson 22.

**Notes**
This first chapter of the image processing course is really simple; it introduces some basic image operations using skimage and numpy. It covered things like color conversion, channel selection, producing histograms, and b&w thresholding. I'm glad to be getting practice at this simple stuff that I skipped when starting the ICV course. I'm sure I'll find some techniques that I can use to enhance the output from PCA simulations.

Even though this first chapter is all very simple, I'm realizing why I used to get so frustrated trying to learn on this site. If you don't just type exactly what they want in the spaces they want it, the exercise won't accept your answer. With so many different ways to do things in Python, it seems like it would be better to just test output. Like how testing usually works. Instead DataCamp seems to rely on a grading system that can apparently only judge the text in a script.

This ICV lsson covered image to image transformations and projective transforms. It makes sense at a surface level, but I'm not going to try to recreate any of it for now. If I come back and do a more thurough delve into this portion of the course, this would be a good lesson to spend more time on.

### March 24, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued PCA reorganization.

**Notes** I'm having a hard time figuring out how to separate, where to put code for the two alternative processing modes. The system could be easily curtailed to contain only the functional models, but I don't want to lose the ability to compare the incredible speed difference from within the same version of the project. 

There are still a couple of methods from the new processing modes that rely on some of the old Cell object update methods in order to get each sim running. Once I untangle that I think I can isolate all of the old Cell stuff to a new object-oriented models file. I hope this can mirror the new processing modes models that are now contained in functional_models.py.

### March 23, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Started Intro to Computer Vision Lesson 22 on Udacity. Started Image Processing in Python at DataCamp. 

**Notes** The ICV course has been so dense for the last several lessons. It is hard to figure out how I could apply the theory they are trudging through, but I know there are gems here and there. It will be worth it as long as I don't break my brain trying to comprehend the hard math.

I'm starting a course at datacamp, [Image Processing in Python](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/image-processing-in-python). It looks like it can offer some useful imaging techniques while I wait for the other course to level out. It has four chapters.

### March 20, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued PCA updates.

### March 19, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued PCA updates.

**Notes** Today working on more performance monitor updates, adding new grid options for setting processing mode, as well as color and visualization options. I'm adding a couple of new examples to explore these new optons.

### March 18, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued PCA updates. Continued IPC lesson 3.

**Notes** I'm having a hard time with logging working the way I want it to work. It is easiest to ditch the logging module and set up my own simple logging with a method in the performance monitoring models. I've also been able to streamline and upgrade those models today.

### March 17, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued IPC lesson 3. Finished last two sections of the functional programming tutorial at Real Python. Begin PCA updates.

**Notes** It seems like there will be a lot of residual optimizing and tidying from the refactor, but for the most part I can start working on other updates.

Today I'm adding a way to switch between processing modes, and looking at improvments to the performance monitoring models. I need a better way to store performance metrics in order to be able to review how code changes are affecting things. Logging seems like too much of a headache to configure for what I want, and may be the source for some slowdown. 

### March 16, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished the first part of the CUDA implementation phase for PCA refactor.

**Notes** I've been trying to get to this milestone for months, it seems. It has been purely frustrating for the last week, so I am extremely relived to be to this point now. Now CUDA is successfully, albeit shakily implemented. It runs so much faster than before. I don't have to record and replay them to observe large grids. I will have to make many more optimizations before I can realize the full speed potential.

The next steps will be much easier to do. I need to continue to optimize the CUDA portions, convert sporadic numpy operations to CUDA equivalents, implement multiprocessing on the CPU end to mitigate all of the CPU-bound bottlenecks, and do other obvious performance improvents. Now that these can be run in real-time, I can slowly chip away at those things as I find them, in-between adding the next features.

### March 13, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued IPC lesson 3. Continued NVIDIA course parts 2 and 3. Continued CUDA implementation for PCA.

### March 12, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued IPC lesson 3. Started CUDA implementation phase for PCA refactor. Started NVIDIA couse parts 2 and 3.

### March 11, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished IPC lesson 1. Started IPC lesson 3. 

**Notes** Skipping lesson 2 interview for now.

### March 10, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued IPC lesson 1. Continued Nvidia course, part 1.

**Notes** I'm working on the problem set for this first lesson. I'm stuck on a strange error that I can't figure out. It is difficult to debug what's going wrong with the CUDA portion. It is difficult to debug in Jupyter notebooks in general; I'm going to do the problem sets in a separate file for working on in VS Code.

### March 9, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued Intro to Parallel Computing, lesson 1. Continued Nvidia course, part 1.

**Notes** I'm documenting IPC course progress in a notebook, like i'm doing for the ICV course. Also like in that course, I'm attempting to translate this course's non-Python stuff into Python stuff. 

This course uses CUDA C, so I'm following the Nvidia couse notebooks and other resources to help translate the course examples into CUDA Python equivalents.

### March 6, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued PCA refactor.

**Notes** This first part of the refactor is done. Simulation is running like it was, but using new methods that operate on the grid as a whole, rather than on individual cells. 

These methods still operate on one cell at a time, so I didn't expect a lot of speedup. For larger grids this approach has sped things up slightly, though, something like 3-6x. I think most of this is because the new methods use and operate on large numpy arrays, rather than having to operate on many more, much smaller numpy arrays.

### March 5, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued PCA refactor.

### March 4, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued PCA refactor.

### March 3, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued PCA refactor.

### March 2, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued PCA refactor.

**Notes** I don't want to change too much with the code, too quickly. I know that it will be easy to break things so that it is difficult to find where things are broken, and waste time. The code is fairly convoluted in some areas and is not easy to debug.

### February 28, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued PCA refactor.

**Notes** There is a lot of work to do for this refactor. I'm not sure how things got to be this convoluted, but it needs a lot of rearranging before I will be able to test the new methods that calculate next steps from a snapshot of grid states.

### February 27, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued PCA refactor.

### February 26, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued NVIDIA course, part 1. Started refactor on Python Cellular Automata ca_models.py. 

**Notes** I think I know enough about the basics to figure out how to rearrange the models in my Python-cellular-automata repository to be able to compute in parallel on the GPU. I think a slow, gradual refactor to an overall more functional approach will be easier than forking. 

### February 25, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished ICV lesson 21. Continued IPC lesson 1. Started NVIDIA course Fundamentals of Accelerated Computing with CUDA Python notebook 1 of 3.

**Notes** This paid NVIDIA course should get me on the right track to knowing which CUDA Python implementation will be most useful for completing the challenges in the Udacity Introduction to Parallel Computing with CUDA C course. 

### February 24, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued IPC lesson 1. Continued Functional Programming in Python at Real Python. 

**Notes** This Intro to Parallel Computing course is using C CUDA, but I want to use Python tools. I'm trying to find the right Python libraries to use.

### February 21, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued ICV lesson 21. Continued Introduction to Parallel Computing lesson 1.

**Today's Progress:** Continued ICV Lesson 14.

### February 4, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished ICV lesson 13. Started ICV Lesson 14.

**Notes** The last few lessons have been very math-heavy explanations of how aliasing is an unfortunate effect of trying to capture continuous signals in a discrete space.

### February 3, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished ICV Lesson 12. Started ICV Lesson 13.

### January 24, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished ICV Lesson 11.

### January 23, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued ICV Lesson 11.

### January 22, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished ICV Lesson 10. Started Lesson 11.

### January 21, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished ICV Lesson 8. Finished Lesson 9.

### January 20, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Started Lesson 8 in Introduction to Computer Vision by Georgia Tech on Udacity.

**Notes** Course Link:  https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud810

### January 17, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished ICV Lesson 6. Finished Lesson 7.

**Notes** I am happy to see the math behind useful edge detection methods. It is neat to see the output from the Sorbel filters. I am just using built in Canny method without recreating the entire process for Lesson 7. 

### January 16, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued ICV Lesson 6. 

### January 15, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Started ICV Lesson 6 lectures.

**Notes** This lesson focuses on finding lines by calculating image gradients. It reviews some basic concepts of multivariate calculus and shows how partial derivatives can be used to determine the locations of lines in an image. The calculus is very straightforward so far.

### January 14, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished ICV Lesson 4 activities. Finished Lesson 5 lectures.

**Notes** I feel good about some newly developed techniques from the lesson 4 challenges. I am through with all of the lesson 5 lectures, but will probably rewatch when I do activities. I still need to complete the template filtering challenges, but am anxious to see other operations now. I will get back to the code as soon as lectures are a little less consumable.

### January 13, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued Lesson 4 for Introduction to Computer Vision from Georgia Tech on Udacity.

**Notes** Recreating the course material in Python feels appropriately suited to my capabilities. The operations on images are still pretty straightforward and logically simple; the challenge is preparing input data and then implementing the operations in Python while limiting myself from using certain prebuilt tools. I feel like this is the best route to being the most appropriately experiened for the things I want to do after this course. 

I am looking forward to making time for projects this week, I think that some of what I have used for filtering challenges could be useful in the PCA project.

### January 10, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued ICV lesson 4.

**Today's Progress:** Continued Intro to Compuuter Vision Lesson 3.

### January 6, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued Intro to Computer Vision. Finished Lesson 2, Started Lesson 3.

**Notes** As an added benefit, I am getting good practice with some very useful numpy methods while trying to translate this course's challenges into Python code.

**Today's Progress:** Continued Intro to Computer Vision. Started Lesson 2.

**Notes:** This lesson covers some very basic operations on image arrays. Here is the file for notes: https://github.com/grant-king/report/blob/master/ICV_challenges/IntroCV_notes.ipynb.
The course uses Matlab but the equivalents are easy enough to convert to OpenCV with Python. I think these first lessons have to start slow; so far everything seems simple and familiar.
