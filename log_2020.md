### January 6, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued Intro to Computer Vision. Finished Lesson 2, Started Lesson 3.

**Notes** As an added benefit, I am getting good practice with some very useful numpy methods while trying to translate this course's challenges into Python code.

### January 2, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued Intro to Computer Vision. Started Lesson 2.

**Notes:** This lesson covers some very basic operations on image arrays. Here is the file for notes: https://github.com/grant-king/report/blob/master/ICV_challenges/IntroCV_notes.ipynb.
The course uses Matlab but the equivalents are easy enough to convert to OpenCV with Python. I think these first lessons have to start slow; so far everything seems simple and familiar.
