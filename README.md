# MOI_progress

This repository is to showcase my exploration of the concepts presented in the YouTube series *The Math of Intelligence* made by Siraj Raval.

I initially forked his syllabus repository but have now made it a stand-alone as I would like to keep track of the commits on this subject during my 100 days of code challenge.
